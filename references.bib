	abstract = {Habitat complexity plays a major role in determining the distribution and structure of ﬁsh assemblages in the aquatic environment. These locations are critical for ecosystem function and have signiﬁcant implications for conservation and management. In this study, we evaluated the utility of remotely sensed lidar (light detection and ranging) data for deriving substrate rugosity (a measure of habitat complexity) on a coral reef in Hawaii. We also assessed the potential application of lidar data for examining the relationship between habitat complexity and Hawaiian reef ﬁsh assemblage characteristics. Lidar-derived rugosity (4 m grid size) was found to be highly correlated with in-situ rugosity and was concluded to be a viable method for measuring rugosity in analogous coral reef environments. We established that lidar-derived rugosity was a good predictor of ﬁsh biomass and demonstrated a strong relationship with several ﬁsh assemblage metrics in hard bottom habitat at multiple spatial resolutions. This research demonstrates (i) the efﬁcacy of lidar data to provide substrate rugosity measures at scales commensurate with the resources and their environment (ii) the applicability of lidar-derived rugosity for examining ﬁsh–habitat relationships on a coral reef in Hawaii and (iii) the potential of lidar to provide information about the seascape structure that can ultimately be used to prioritize areas for conservation and management.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean seagrasses have been hailed for their numerous ecosystem services, yet they are undergoing a decline in their coverage. The major complication with resolving this tendency is the sparsity of data on their overall distribution. This study addresses the suitability of the recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite for mapping the distribution of Mediterranean seagrass meadows. A comprehensive methodology is presented which applies atmospheric and analytical water column corrections and compares the performance of three diﬀerent supervised classiﬁers. Remote sensing of the Thermaikos Gulf, northwestern Aegean Sea (Greece, eastern Mediterranean Sea) reveals that the utilization of Support Vector Machines on water column corrected reﬂectances yields best accuracies. Two Mediterranean seagrasses, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, cover a total submerged area of 1.48 km2 between depths of 1.4–16.5 m. With its 10-m spatial resolution and 5-day revisit frequency, Sentinel-2 imagery can mitigate the Mediterranean seagrass distribution data gap and allow better management and conservation in the future in a retrospective, time- and cost-eﬀective fashion.},

	abstract = {Traditional surface area and volume quantiﬁcation techniques for scleractinian corals are often destructive or inaccurate. Therefore, non-destructive 3D scanning methods have been applied as minimally invasive alternative. However, it remains largely unknown how the reproducibility of the measurement is affected by the complexity of the coral colonies. It is also unclear how the scanning procedure (handling, exposure to air, and light of the scanner) impacts the corals’ health. In this study, we used a high-end handheld 3D scanner, which combines a structured-light with an image-based approach, to investigate the reproducibility of surface area and volume measurements as well as handling effects. Corals with different shape complexity, covering branching and massive species, were used as model organisms. The variance of repetitive scans ranged from 0.13\% to 1.31\% for volume and from 0.09\% to 0.58\% for surface area calculations. Linear regression models indicated that reproducibility decreases with increasing complexity of the coral. Excessive scanning caused an increase or decrease of growth rates, depending on the studied species. However, it did not impair coral health. We conclude that 3D scanning is a highly precise, reproducible, and minimally invasive method for coral surface area and volume measurements, which allows for quick processing of large datasets. Detailed technical recommendations for the application of 3D scanning in coral research are provided in the manuscript.},

This study determined whether 3D models of an ecologically relevant reef structure, the coral bommie, could be constructed using structure from motion and be reliably used to measure bommie volume and surface area between different observers and over time. We also determined whether the number of images used to construct a model had an impact on the ﬁnal measurements. Three dimensional models were constructed of over twenty coral bommies from Heron Island, a coral cay at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef. This study did not detect any signiﬁcant observer effect, and there were no signiﬁcant differences in measurements over four sampling days. The mean measurement error across all bommies and between observers was 15 ± 2\% for volume measurements and 12 ± 1\% for surface area measurements. There was no relationship between the number of pictures taken for a reconstruction and the measurements from that model, however, more photographs were necessary to be able to reconstruct complete coral bommies larger than 1 m3. These results suggest that structure from motion is a viable tool for ongoing monitoring of ecologically-signiﬁcant coral reefs, especially to establish effects of disturbances, provided the measurement error is considered.},

This, however, renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named PointNet, provides a uniﬁed architecture for applications ranging from object classiﬁcation, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efﬁcient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.},

	abstract = {Visual 3D reconstruction techniques provide rich ecological and habitat structural information from underwater imagery. However, an unaided swimmer or diver struggles to navigate precisely over larger extents with consistent image overlap needed for visual reconstruction. While underwater robots have demonstrated systematic coverage of areas much larger than the footprint of a single image, access to suitable robotic systems is limited and requires specialized operators. Furthermore, robots are poor at navigating hydrodynamic habitats such as shallow coral reefs. We present a simple approach that constrains the motion of a swimmer using a line unwinding from a fixed central drum. The resulting motion is the involute of a circle, a spiral-­like path with constant spacing between revolutions. We test this survey method at a broad range of habitats and hydrodynamic conditions encircling Lizard Island in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The approach generates fast, structured, repeatable, and large-­extent surveys ({\textasciitilde}110 m2 in 15 min) that can be performed with two people and are superior to the commonly used “mow the lawn” method. The amount of image overlap is a design parameter, allowing for surveys that can then be reliably used in an automated processing pipeline to generate 3D reconstructions, orthographically projected mosaics, and structural complexity indices. The individual images or full mosaics can also be labeled for benthic diversity and cover estimates. The survey method we present can serve as a standard approach to repeatedly collecting underwater imagery for high-­resolution 2D mosaics and 3D reconstructions covering spatial extents much larger than a single image footprint without requiring sophisticated robotic systems or lengthy deployment of visual guides. As such, it opens up cost-­effective novel observations to inform studies relating habitat structure to ecological processes and biodiversity at scales and spatial resolutions not readily available previously.},

However, the seagrass population is declining worldwide, and 30–40\% of the seagrass areas in the Philippines have been lost in the last 50 years. The quadrat method by scuba diving has been widely used to study seagrass distribution and measure dugong feeding trails. However, this method is affected by observational skills of the divers and the survey time is usually limited by air capacity in the tank and effort for high-resolution sampling. In this study, a new method of seagrass mapping and quantiﬁcation of dugong trail distribution is proposed and tested. The method produces clear and high-resolution data using acoustic and optical devices with high efﬁciency. The ﬁeld study was conducted at Mayo Bay, southeastern Philippines. Continuous optical images were taken using a water-proof digital still camera from the sea surface by a swimmer with snorkel. Using the software PhotoScan, 3D optical images were generated from the continuous photos. The resolution of the optical image is 2.96 ± 0.17 (SD) mm per pixel so that a leaf of Halophila sp. is identiﬁable. By counting the pixels of dugong trails, the feeding rates were calculated and the values were 13.5\% in the survey area 1 and 7.1\% in area 2. The quantiﬁcation method, based on high-resolution optical image generated by continuous photos, can be useful for assessing the status of the seagrass meadows and the distribution of dugong trails.},

In this work, motivations behind the need for systematic underwater calibrations are provided, then experimental tests using a specifically designed photogrammetric modular test object in laboratory and at sea are reported. The experiments are carried out using a Nikon D750 24 Mpx DSLR camera with a 24 mm f2.8 AF/D lens coupled with a NIMAR NI3D750ZM housing, equipped first with a dome and, successively, with a flat port. To quantify the degradation of image quality, MTF measurements are carried out, then the outcomes of self-calibrating bundle adjustment calibrations are shown and commented. Optical phenomena like field curvature as well as chromatic aberration and astigmatism are analysed and their implications on the degradation of image quality is factored in the bundle adjustment through a different weighting of 2D image observations.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of Earth surface processes is rapidly advancing as new remote sensing technologies such as LiDAR and close-range digital photogrammetry become more accessible and affordable. A very-high spatial resolution digital terrain model (DTM) and orthophoto mosaic (mm scale) were produced using close-range digital photogrammetry based on ‘Structure-from-Motion’ (SfM) algorithms for a 250 m transect along a shallow coral reef ﬂat on Heron Reef, Great Barrier Reef. The precise terrain data were used to characterise surface roughness, a critical factor affecting ecological and physical processes on the reef. Three roughness parameters, namely the root mean square height, tortuosity (or rugosity) and fractal dimension, were derived and compared in order to asses which one better characterises reef ﬂat roughness. The typical relief across the shallow reef ﬂat was 0.1 m with a maximum value of 0.42 m. Coral reef terrain roughness, as characterised by the three chosen parameters, generally increased towards the middle of the transect where live coral covers most of the reef ﬂat and decreases towards the edges of the transect. The fractal dimension (values ranging from 2.2 to 2.59) best characterised reef roughness, as evidenced by a closer agreement with the distribution of known coral benthic substrates. This is the ﬁrst study quantifying scale-independent roughness of a coral reef at benthic and biotope/patch levels (cm-m). The readily available and cost-effective methods presented are highly appropriate for data collection, processing and analysis to generate very-high spatial resolution DTMs and orthophoto mosaics of shallow and energetic coral reefs.},

	abstract = {One of the main obstacles for biological assessments of coral reefs over large spatial scales is the ability to link data obtained at the laboratory scale to spatially large data sets. This is particularly the case when trying to assess the ecological function of microbial processes following dramatic large-scale events such as mass coral bleaching. To be able to infer ecological function of ﬁeld corals from laboratory measurement standardised to surface area it is imperative to be able to measure the actual surface area of corals in-situ. There have been several approaches proposed to estimate the three-dimensional surface area of ﬁeld corals. While these have been shown to be reliable for simple coral growth forms, large degrees of error are introduced when applying them to complex growth forms. This paper reﬁnes a technique for calculating the three-dimensional surface area based on the projected surface area, with errors associated with complex growth forms reduced to b 5\%. Once developed, the simple mathematical relationship (called the surface index) can be used to estimate the three-dimensional surface area of ﬁeld corals from photograph or video imagery, allowing physiological parameters of corals determined at the sub-colony scale to whole colony and spatially large data sets of coral reefs. The effectiveness of using laser scanning techniques to derive threedimensional images of corals is also discussed.},

Nowadays, imaging technologies and image processing approaches allow acquisition of threedimensional (3D) datasets that can be converted to virtual models. These models can be made easily accessible and shared among collaborators or researchers using the Internet. Here, we compare high cost and low cost technologies on coral skeletons as well as imaging phantoms for accurate reference. We generated 3D models that were compared. Even though CT scanning and photogrammetry are the most accurate methods the latter is far less costly. It also allows for texture mapping, an essential tool in the ﬁeld, and easy dataset handling. We submitted these 3D virtual models to experts for taxonomical identiﬁcation, and they identiﬁed all specimens accurately. Finally, we further discuss applicability of our approach on museum collections, living corals, and ﬁeld work.},

The accuracy of underwater 3D modelling is affected by more parameters than in single media cases. This study is part of a larger project on 3D measurements of temporal change of coral cover in tropical waters. It compares the accuracies of 3D point clouds generated by using images acquired from a system camera mounted in an underwater housing and the popular GoPro cameras respectively. A precisely measured calibration frame was placed in the target scene in order to provide accurate control information and also quantify the errors of the modelling procedure. In addition, several objects (cinder blocks) with various shapes were arranged in the air and underwater and 3D point clouds were generated by automated image matching. These were further used to examine the relative accuracy of the point cloud generation by comparing the point clouds of the individual objects with the objects measured by the system camera in air (the best possible values). Given a working distance of about 1.5 m, the GoPro camera can achieve a relative accuracy of 1.3 mm in air and 2.0 mm in water. The system camera achieved an accuracy of 1.8 mm in water, which meets our requirements for coral measurement in this system.},

	abstract = {Ecological measurements in marine settings are often constrained in space and time, with spatial heterogeneity obscuring broader generalisations. While advances in remote sensing, integrative modelling and meta-analysis enable generalisations from ﬁeld observations, there is an underlying need for high-resolution, standardised and geo-referenced ﬁeld data. Here, we evaluate a new approach aimed at optimising data collection and analysis to assess broad-scale patterns of coral reef community composition using automatically annotated underwater imagery, captured along 2 km transects. We validate this approach by investigating its ability to detect spatial (e.g., across regions) and temporal (e.g., over years) change, and by comparing automated annotation errors to those of multiple human annotators. Our results indicate that change of coral reef benthos can be captured at high resolution both spatially and temporally, with an average error below 5\%, among key benthic groups. Cover estimation errors using automated annotation varied between 2\% and 12\%, slightly larger than human errors (which varied between 1\% and 7\%), but small enough to detect signiﬁcant changes among dominant groups. Overall, this approach allows a rapid collection of in-situ observations at larger spatial scales (km) than previously possible, and provides a pathway to link, calibrate, and validate broader analyses across even larger spatial scales (10–10,000 km2).},

Growth and shrinkage rates, in terms of area gained or lost per month, were measured for both crustose corallines over a 2 year period by photographic and computer-assisted image analysis. No seasonal pattern in growth or shrinkage was found for either species. M. alternans grew and shrank at signiﬁcantly higher rates than L. frondosum. Growth rates for both species were over an order of magnitude lower than those previously reported for other Mediterranean and tropical species, and were similar to reports for crustose corallines in Arctic and temperate waters. Almost 50 \% of monitored M. alternans thalli underwent at least one ﬁssion or fusion event over the 2 year monitoring period, while in L. frondosum these events were rarely observed. Interspeciﬁc diﬀerences in rates of growth, shrinkage, ﬁssion and fusion appear to depend on diﬀerences in thallus thickness (M. alternans is thin and L. frondosum is thick). These diﬀerences were interpreted as distinct biological strategies of persistence and the occupation of primary substratum.},

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates how multi-scale measures of rugosity, slope and aspect can be derived from fine-scale bathymetric reconstructions created from geo-referenced stereo imagery. We generate three-dimensional reconstructions over large spatial scales using data collected by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), manned submersibles and diver-held imaging systems. We propose a new method for calculating rugosity in a Delaunay triangulated surface mesh by projecting areas onto the plane of best fit using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Slope and aspect can be calculated with very little extra effort, and fitting a plane serves to decouple rugosity from slope. We compare the results of the virtual terrain complexity calculations with experimental results using conventional in-situ measurement methods. We show that performing calculations over a digital terrain reconstruction is more flexible, robust and easily repeatable. In addition, the method is non-contact and provides much less environmental impact compared to traditional survey techniques. For diver-based surveys, the time underwater needed to collect rugosity data is significantly reduced and, being a technique based on images, it is possible to use robotic platforms that can operate beyond diver depths. Measurements can be calculated exhaustively at multiple scales for surveys with tens of thousands of images covering thousands of square metres. The technique is demonstrated on data gathered by a diver-rig and an AUV, on small single-transect surveys and on a larger, dense survey that covers over 3,750 m2. Stereo images provide 3D structure as well as visual appearance, which could potentially feed into automated classification techniques. Our multi-scale rugosity, slope and aspect measures have already been adopted in a number of marine science studies. This paper presents a detailed description of the method and thoroughly validates it against traditional in-situ measurements.},

Recent developments of new habitatmapping techniques make this advice more achievable, but the success of such an approach depends largely on our ability to define habitat types in a way that is ecologically relevant. We devised and tested the ecological relevance of a set of habitat-type definitions through our participation in a stakeholder-driven process to design a network of MPAs, focusing on no-take marine reserves in the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve, San Andr´es Archipelago, Colombia. A priori definitions of habitat types were ecologically relevant, in that our habitat-type definitions corresponded to identifiable and unique characteristics in the ecological communities found there. The identification of ecological pathways and connectivity among habitats also helped in designing ecologically relevant reserve boundaries. Our findings contributed to the overall design process, along with our summary of other general principles of marine reserve design. Extensive stakeholder input provided information concerning the resources and their patterns of use. These inputs also contributed to the reserve design process. We anticipate success for the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve at achieving conservation and social goals because its zoning process includes detailed yet flexible scientific advice and the participation of stakeholders at every step.},

	abstract = {In tropical reef ecosystems corals are the key habitat builders providing most ecosystem structure, which inﬂuences coral reef biodiversity and resilience. Remote sensing applications have progressed signiﬁcantly and photogrammetry together with application of structure from motion software is emerging as a leading technique to create three-dimensional (3D) models of corals and reefs from which biophysical properties of structural complexity can be quantiﬁed. This enables the addressing of a range of important marine research questions, such as what the role of habitat complexity is in driving key ecological processes (i.e., foraging). Yet, it is essential to assess the accuracy and precision of photogrammetric measurements to support their application in mapping, monitoring and quantifying coral reef form and structure. This study evaluated the precision (by repeated modeling) and accuracy (by comparison with laser reference models) of geometry and structural complexity metrics derived from photogrammetric 3D models of marine benthic habitat at two ecologically relevant spatial extents; individual coral colonies of a range of common morphologies and patches of reef area of 100s of square metres. Surface rugosity measurements were generally precise across all morphologies and spatial extents with average differences in the geometry of replicate models of 1–6 mm for coral colonies and 25 mm for the reef area. Precision decreased with complexity of the coral morphology, with metrics for small massive corals being the most precise (1\% coefﬁcient of variation (CV) in surface rugosity) and metrics for bottlebrush corals being the least precise (10\% CV in surface rugosity). There was no indication however that precision was related to complexity for the patch-scale modelling. The 3D geometry of coral models differed by only 1–3 mm from laser reference models. However, high spatial variation in these differences around the model led to a consistent underestimation of surface rugosity values for all morphs of between 8\% and 37\%. This study highlights the utility of several off-the-shelf photogrammetry tools for the measurement of structural complexity across a range of scales relevant to ecologist and managers. It also provides important information on the accuracy and precision of these systems which should allow for their targeted use by non-experts in computer vision within these contexts.},

	abstract = {Ecological habitats with greater structural complexity contain more species due to increased niche diversity. This is especially apparent on coral reefs where individual coral colonies aggregate to give a reef its morphology, species zonation, and three dimensionality. Structural complexity is classically measured with a reef rugosity index, which is the ratio of a straight line transect to the distance a flexible chain of equal length travels when draped over the reef substrate; yet, other techniques from visual categories to remote sensing have been used to characterize structural complexity at scales from microhabitats to reefscapes. Reef-scale methods either lack quantitative precision or are too time consuming to be routinely practical, while remotely sensed indices are mismatched to the finer scale morphology of coral colonies and reef habitats. In this communication a new digital technique, Digital Reef Rugosity (DRR) is described which utilizes a self-contained water level gauge enabling a diver to quickly and accurately characterize rugosity with non-invasive millimeter scale measurements of coral reef surface height at decimeter intervals along meter scale transects. The precise measurements require very little post-processing and are easily imported into a spreadsheet for statistical analyses and modeling. To assess its applicability we investigated the relationship between DRR and fish community structure at four coral reef sites on Menjangan Island off the northwest corner of Bali, Indonesia and one on mainland Bali to the west of Menjangan Island; our findings show a positive relationship between DRR and fish diversity. Since structural complexity drives key ecological processes on coral reefs, we consider that DRR may become a useful quantitative community-level descriptor to characterize reef complexity.},

The three-dimensional (3D) size and structure of corals are directly related to many ecosystem values and functions. Most methods to estimate colony surface area have been limited to laboratory settings and cannot be used for field corals. Photographic methods for digital 3D reconstruction were applied here to determine the accuracy of three different approaches for estimating colony surface area of field corals from simple underwater measurements. The approaches include a volumetric size-class method, a hemispherical surrogate and a suite of log–linear models generated from stepwise multiple regression analyses of digitallyreconstructed colonies. For each approach, surface area values were calculated from field measurements of colony size and the accuracy was determined by comparison with digitally-derived values for the same colonies. Accuracy varied among approaches; log–linear models (12\% difference) were most accurate, followed by the hemispherical surrogate (17\% difference) and size-classes (40\% difference). The log–linear and hemispherical surrogate approaches are potentially applicable to at least nine common coral species. The photographic reconstruction method, although time-consuming and not intended for routine application, was shown by comparison with laser-scanned images to provide a highly accurate method for determining 3D colony surface area.},

	abstract = {Habitat structural complexity is one of the most important factors in determining the makeup of biological communities. Recent advances in structure-­from-­motion and photogrammetry have resulted in a proliferation of 3D digital representations of habitats from which structural complexity can be measured. Little attention has been paid to quantifying the measurement errors associated with these techniques, including the variability of results under different surveying and environmental conditions. Such errors have the potential to confound studies that compare habitat complexity over space and time. This study evaluated the accuracy, precision, and bias in measurements of marine habitat structural complexity derived from structure-­from-­motion and photogrammetric measurements using repeated surveys of artificial reefs (with known structure) as well as natural coral reefs. We quantified measurement errors as a function of survey image coverage, actual surface rugosity, and the morphological community composition of the habitat-­forming organisms (reef corals). Our results indicated that measurements could be biased by up to 7.5\% of the total observed ranges of structural complexity based on the environmental conditions present during any particular survey. Positive relationships were found between measurement errors and actual complexity, and the strength of these relationships was increased when coral morphology and abundance were also used as predictors. The numerous advantages of structure-­from-­motion and photogrammetry techniques for quantifying and investigating marine habitats will mean that they are likely to replace traditional measurement techniques (e.g., chain-­and-t­ ape). To this end, our results have important implications for data collection and the interpretation of measurements when examining changes in habitat complexity using structure-­from-­motion and photogrammetry.},

	abstract = {Coralligenous concretions, the unique calcareous formations of biogenic origin in Mediterranean benthic environments, are produced by the accumulation of encrusting algae growing in dim light conditions. This review provides an overview of the results obtained by the main studies dealing with these formations, including the environmental factors which inﬂuence the development of coralligenous communities, their distribution, types, assemblages, builders and eroders, the biotic relationships and processes that create and destroy coralligenous assemblages, their dynamics and seasonality, and the functioning of several outstanding and key species. Special attention is devoted to the biodiversity of coralligenous communities and a ﬁrst estimation of the number of species reported for this habitat is provided. Major disturbances affecting coralligenous communities are discussed, ranging from large-scale events that are probably related to global environmental changes to degradation by waste water or invasive species. Degradation by ﬁshing activities and by divers is also considered. Finally, the main gaps in current scientiﬁc knowledge of coralligenous communities are listed and some recommendations are made regarding their protection.},

	abstract = {Photogrammetric methods for dense 3D surface reconstruction are increasingly available to both professional and amateur users who have requirements that span a wide variety of applications. One of the key concerns in choosing an appropriate method is to understand the achievable accuracy and how choices made within the workﬂow can alter that outcome. In this paper we consider accuracy in two components: the ability to generate a correctly scaled 3D model; and the ability to automatically deliver a high quality data set that provides good agreement to a reference surface. The determination of scale information is particularly important, since a network of images usually only provides angle measurements and thus leads to unscaled geometry. A solution is the introduction of known distances in object space, such as base lines between camera stations or distances between control points. In order to avoid using known object distances, the method presented in this paper exploits a calibrated stereo camera utilizing the calibrated base line information from the camera pair as an observational based geometric constraint. The method provides distance information throughout the object volume by orbiting the object.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, significant efforts have been made to describe fish-habitat associations. However, most studies have oversimplified actual connections between fish assemblages and their habitats by using univariate correlations. The purpose of this study was to identify the features of habitat forming corals that facilitate and influences assemblages of associated species such as fishes. For this we developed threedimensional models of colonies of Acropora cervicornis to estimate geometry (length and height), structural complexity (i.e., volume, density of branches, etc.) and biological features of the colonies (i.e., live coral tissue, algae). We then correlated these colony characteristics with the associated fish assemblage using multivariate analyses. We found that geometry and complexity were better predictors of the structure of fish community, compared to other variables such as percentage of live coral tissue or algae. Combined, the geometry of each colony explained 40\% of the variability of the fish assemblage structure associated with this coral species; 61\% of the abundance and 69\% of fish richness, respectively. Our study shows that three-dimensional reconstructions of discrete colonies of Acropora cervicornis provides a useful description of the colonial structural complexity and may explain a great deal of the variance in the structure of the associated coral reef fish community. This demonstration of the strongly traitdependent ecosystem role of this threatened species has important implications for restoration and conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a stereo photogrammetry method that allows accurate measurements of volume for sessile epibenthic organisms. It represents a novel approach based on multiple views (five stereo image pairs) from a purpose built stereo digital still camera system combined with a three-dimensional reconstruction software program (CAM). The bias, accuracy, precision and efficiency of the method were assessed in the laboratory using models with three levels of morphological complexity (simple, moderate and complex morphologies) and two sizes (large and small). The technique did not show any biases to observer experience, with no significant difference among observers (p N 0.05). Volume measurements made with CAM were very accurate when compared with the water displacement volume of each model, with an overall mean error of about −3\% (S.E. ± 1\%). The CAM volume measurements were more accurate on complex models and moderately complex models than on models with simple morphologies. Also, large models had a higher accuracy than small models. Volume measurements made with CAM were also highly precise with the lowest precision observed being ±2\% of the volume estimate. The time required for a volume estimation using the CAM method was also highly efficient, and the longest time taken for a volume estimation was on average 1 h and 36 min, making it the fastest reported three-dimensional reconstruction method. In field applications, volume estimations of four sponges were all within the observed accuracy, precision and efficiency established during laboratory trials. The accuracy, precision and efficiency demonstrated by the CAM method make this technique highly suitable for routine measurements of the volume of sessile epibenthic organisms.},

We developed new methods using underwater stereo-imagery spanning 4 years (2010–2013) to reconstruct 3D models of coral reef areas and quantiﬁed both structural complexity at two spatial resolutions (2.5 and 25 cm) and benthic community composition to characterize changes after an unprecedented thermal anomaly on the west coast of Australia in 2011. Structural complexity increased at both resolutions in quadrats (4 m2) that bleached, but not those that did not bleach. Changes in complexity were driven by species-speciﬁc responses to warming, highlighting the importance of identifying small-scale dynamics to disentangle ecological responses to disturbance. We demonstrate an effective, repeatable method for quantifying the relationship among community composition, structural complexity and ocean warming, improving predictions of the response of marine ecosystems to environmental change.},

	abstract = {Intertidal ecosystems have primarily been studied using field-based sampling; remote sensing offers the ability to collect data over large areas in a snapshot of time that could complement field-based sampling methods by extrapolating them into the wider spatial and temporal context. Conventional remote sensing tools (such as satellite and aircraft imaging) provide data at limited spatial and temporal resolutions and relatively high costs for small-scale environmental science and ecologically-focussed studies. In this paper, we describe a low-cost, kite-based imaging system and photogrammetric/ mapping procedure that was developed for constructing high-resolution, three-dimensional, multi-spectral terrain models of intertidal rocky shores. The processing procedure uses automatic image feature detection and matching, structure-frommotion and photo-textured terrain surface reconstruction algorithms that require minimal human input and only a small number of ground control points and allow the use of cheap, consumer-grade digital cameras. The resulting maps combine imagery at visible and near-infrared wavelengths and topographic information at sub-centimeter resolutions over an intertidal shoreline 200 m long, thus enabling spatial properties of the intertidal environment to be determined across a hierarchy of spatial scales. Results of the system are presented for an intertidal rocky shore at Jervis Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Potential uses of this technique include mapping of plant (micro- and macro-algae) and animal (e.g. gastropods) assemblages at multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

In this study, Worldview-2 (WV-2) imagery was combined with ﬁeld sampling to demonstrate the capability of mapping species type, percentage cover, and above-ground biomass of seagrasses in monsoonal southern Thailand. A high accuracy positioning technique, involving the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), was used to record ﬁeld sample data positions and reduce uncertainties in matching locations between satellite and ﬁeld data sets. Our results showed high accuracy (90.67\%) in mapping seagrass distribution and moderate accuracies for mapping percentage cover and species type (73.74\% and 75.00\%, respectively). Seagrass species type mapping was successfully achieved despite discrimination confusion among Halophila ovalis, Thalassia hemprichii, and Enhalus acoroides species with greater than 50\% cover. The green, yellow, and near infrared spectral channels of WV-2 were used to estimate the above-ground biomass using a multiple linear regression model (RMSE of ˘10.38 g¨ DW/m2, R = 0.68). The average total above-ground biomass was 23.95 ˘ 10.38 g¨ DW/m2. The seagrass maps produced in this study are an important step towards measuring the attributes of seagrass biodiversity and can be used as inputs to seagrass dynamic models and conservation efforts.},

The traditional method to obtain vegetation distribution information is building vegetation index which can be used as the threshold for vegetation recognition, with the spectral characteristics of vegetation in remote sensing images form satellite or aviation, especially the near infrared band. In recent years, low-altitude photogrammetry technology based on UAV has developed rapidly. But the UAV images do not contain near-infrared band information, many researchers have adopted visible light spectral characteristics to construct new vegetation index and achieved many progress. In this paper, taking the Gobi region of northwest China as a example, we intruduced the methods for multi-scale segmentation and classification of DOM which generated from the UAV images. Further, based on eCognition Developer, we extracted visible light-based vegetation indices including NGRDI, NGBDI, VDVI, GLI, and ExG, and assessed the vegetation recognition effect of these five indices.},

Changes in P. oceanica bed spatial distribution (limits and extent) during these 85 years were analyzed in terms of concordance (remaining areas), positive discordance (expanding areas) or negative discordance (lost areas). Lost areas were linked with direct or indirect impacts of coastal development (artiﬁcialized coastlines (namely harbours, ports of refuge, landﬁlls, artiﬁcial beaches, groynes and pontoons, submarine pipelines and aquatic farms) visible on the photographs. The comparison showed that 73\% of the shallow limits have declined. Considering spatial extent, remaining seagrass meadows areas accounted for the major part (85\%), while lost areas accounted for 13\% and expanding areas for 1.1\%. Lost areas were mainly linked with artiﬁcial coastlines but 44\% remained with undetermined causes (invisible pressures and/or mixed effects). The analysis of 96 coastal facilities creating the artiﬁcial (namely man-made) coastlines showed that the highest impact over the longest distance (5 km) was caused by harbours. Only artiﬁcial beaches had such a distant impact. Pontoons were the least surrounded by lost seagrass meadows areas. These quantitative data offer important information for marine conservation.},

	abstract = {During the last ﬁfty years, there has been a dramatic increase in the development of anthropogenic activities, and this is particularly threatening to marine coastal ecosystems. The management of these multiple and simultaneous anthropogenic pressures requires reliable and precise data on their distribution, as well as information (data, modelling) on their potential eﬀects on sensitive ecosystems. Focusing on Posidonia oceanica beds, a threatened habitat-forming seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, we developed a statistical approach to study the complex relationship between human multiple activities and ecosystem status. We used Random Forest modelling to explain the degradation status of P. oceanica (deﬁned herein as the shift from seagrass bed to dead matte) as a function of depth and 10 anthropogenic pressures along the French Mediterranean coast (1700 km of coastline including Corsica). Using a 50 × 50 m grid cells dataset, we obtained a particularly accurate model explaining 71.3\% of the variance, with a Pearson correlation of 0.84 between predicted and observed values. Human-made coastline, depth, coastal population, urbanization, and agriculture were the best global predictors of P. oceanica's degradation status. Aquaculture was the least important predictor, although its local individual inﬂuence was among the highest. Non-linear relationship between predictors and seagrass beds status was detected with tipping points (i.e. thresholds) for all variables except agriculture and industrial eﬄuents. Using these tipping points, we built a map representing the coastal seagrass beds classiﬁed into four categories according to an increasing pressure gradient and its risk of phase shift. Our approach provides important information that can be used to help managers preserve this essential and endangered ecosystem.},

	abstract = {The Posidonia oceanica meadow constitutes a key ecosystem in the sublittoral zone of the Mediterranean, from both an ecological and physical equilibrium perspective. In addition, it harbors a very high species diversity. Posidonia oceanica beds are very sensitive to disturbances caused by human activity (e.g. coastal development, pollution, turbidity, anchoring, etc.) and their loss has been observed in a number of regions. The aim of the monitoring of P. oceanica meadows along the Provence and French Riviera coasts is (i) to evidence possible new losses and (ii) to evaluate through a biological indicator the efficiency of regional policies (e.g. setting up of sewage treatment plants, reduction in industrial and domestic pollution levels in the rivers flowing towards the Mediterranean, establishment of Marine Protected Areas, banning of new harbors and reclamations). Monitoring tools operate at three scales: (i) system scale (aerial photographs, measurement of bottom cover, permanent transects), (ii) meadow scale (e.g. photographs of Posidonia around cement markers positioned along meadow limits, shoot-density, permanent quadrats) and (iii) shoot scale (e.g. plagiotopic to orthotropic rhizome ratio, laying bare of the rhizomes, lepidochronology, leaf epiphytes, leaf biometry). Several monitoring programs are based on these tools, or some of them. The Posidonia Monitoring Network (PMN; RSP in French) is the most extensive. It was set-up in 1984 and concerns 33 survey sites. Between 1984 and 1999, the percentage of sites at which the P. oceanica meadow was seen to be in expansion increased from 21 to 42\%. This is consistent with the increase in the percentage of sewage which is processed in treatment plants, from less than 10\% in the early 1980s and close to 100\% today.},

Video-photographic devices and open source software for acquiring and managing 3D optical data rapidly became more and more effective and economically viable, making underwater 3D mapping an easier task to carry out. 3D reconstruction of the underwater scene can be obtained with photogrammetric techniques that require just one or more digital cameras, also in stereo configuration.

In this paper we used a non-destructive photo mosaicing technology to quantify seagrass distribution and abundance, and explore beneﬁts of micro-cartographic analysis. Furthermore, the use of photogrammetric tools enhanced the method, which proved to be efﬁcient due to its use of low-cost instruments and its simplicity of implementation.

Three different methods are presented and compared for precision alignment of imagery maps collected over a range of time-scales from 12 hours to two years between dives. The ﬁrst method uses Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features computed over imagery mosaics to compute the relative translational offset between repeat dives. The second method employs scan-optimisation using the bathymetry generated via structure-from-motion thus capturing more stable features in the environment, lending itself to larger timescale registration. The third method uses mutual information optimisation to register imagery maps, providing robustness to changes in the colour and brightness of objects in an underwater scene across multiple years. Results are presented from ﬁeld data collected using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in sites across the Australian coast between 2009 and 2011.},

	abstract = {Seagrass habitats in subtidal coastal waters provide a variety of ecosystem functions and services and there is an increasing need to acquire information on spatial and temporal dynamics of this resource. Here, we explored the capability of IKONOS (IKO) data of high resolution (4 m) for mapping seagrass cover [submerged aquatic vegetation (\%SAV) cover] along the mid-western coast of Florida, USA. We also compared seagrass maps produced with IKO data with that obtained using the Landsat TM sensor with lower resolution (30 m). Both IKO and TM data, collected in October 2009, were preprocessed to calculate water depth invariant bands to normalize the effect of varying depth on bottom spectra recorded by the two satellite sensors and further the textural information was extracted from IKO data. Our results demonstrate that the high resolution IKO sensor produced a higher accuracy than the TM sensor in a three-class \% SAV cover classiﬁcation. Of note is that the OA of \%SAV cover mapping at our study area created with IKO data was 5–20\% higher than that from other studies published. We also examined the spatial distribution of seagrass over a spatial range of 4–240 m using the Ripley’s K function [L(d)] and IKO data that represented four different grain sizes [4 m (one IKO pixel), 8 m (2 × 2 IKO pixels), 12 m (3 × 3 IKO pixels), and 16 m (4 × 4 IKO pixels)] from moderate-dense seagrass cover along a set of six transects. The Ripley’s K metric repeatedly indicated that seagrass cover representing 4 m × 4 m pixels displayed a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern over distances of {\textless}4–8 m, and a random or slightly clustered pattern of cover over 9–240 m. The spatial pattern of seagrass cover created with the three additional grain sizes (i.e., 2 × 24 m IKO pixels, 3 × 34 m IKO pixels, and 4 × 4 m IKO pixels) show a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern across 4–32 m and a random or slightly clustered pattern across 33–240 m. Given the ﬁrst report on using satellite observations to quantify seagrass spatial patterns at a spatial scale from 4 m to 240 m, our novel analyses of moderate-dense SAV cover utilizing Ripley’s K function illustrate how data obtained from the IKO sensor revealed seagrass spatial information that would be undetected by the TM sensor with a 30 m pixel size. Use of the seagrass classiﬁcation scheme here, along with data from the IKO sensor with enhanced resolution, offers an opportunity to synoptically record seagrass cover dynamics at both small and large spatial scales.},

This information is needed for identifying priority conservation sites and to help coastal ecosystem managers and stakeholders to develop conservation strategies and design a resilient network of protected marine areas. The results were based on an object-based image analysis of 50 Landsat-8 satellite images. The time window of image acquisition was between June 2013 and July 2015. In total, the seagrass coverage in Greek waters was estimated at 2619 km2. The largest coverages of individual seagrass meadows were found around Lemnos Island (124 km2), Corfu Island (46 km2), and East Peloponnese (47 km2). The accuracy assessment of the detected areas was based on 62 Natura 2000 sites, for which habitat maps were available. The mean total accuracy for all 62 sites was estimated at 76.3\%.},

	abstract = {Nearly half the world’s vascular plant species and one-third of terrestrial vertebrates are endemic to 25 “hotspots” of biodiversity, each of which has at least 1500 endemic plant species. None of these hotspots have more than one-third of their pristine habitat remaining. Historically, they covered 12\% of the land’s surface, but today their intact habitat covers only 1.4\% of the land. As a result of this habitat loss, we expect many of the hotspot endemics to have either become extinct or—because much of the habitat loss is recent—to be threatened with extinction. We used World Conservation Union [IUCN] Red Lists to test this expectation. Overall, between one-half and two-thirds of all threatened plants and 57\% of all threatened terrestrial vertebrates are hotspot endemics. For birds and mammals, in general, predictions of extinction in the hotspots based on habitat loss match numbers of species independently judged extinct or threatened. In two classes of hotspots the match is not as close. On oceanic islands, habitat loss underestimates extinction because introduced species have driven extinctions beyond those caused by habitat loss on these islands. In large hotspots, conversely, habitat loss overestimates extinction, suggesting scale dependence (this effect is also apparent for plants). For reptiles, amphibians, and plants, many fewer hotspot endemics are considered threatened or extinct than we would expect based on habitat loss. This mismatch is small in temperate hotspots, however, suggesting that many threatened endemic species in the poorly known tropical hotspots have yet to be included on the IUCN Red Lists. We then asked in which hotspots the consequences of further habitat loss (either absolute or given current rates of deforestation) would be most serious. Our results suggest that the Eastern Arc and Coastal Forests of Tanzania-Kenya, Philippines, and Polynesia-Micronesia can least afford to lose more habitat and that, if current deforestation rates continue, the Caribbean, Tropical Andes, Philippines, Mesoamerica, Sundaland, Indo-Burma, Madagascar, and Chocó–Darién–Western Ecuador will lose the most species in the near future. Without urgent conservation intervention, we face mass extinctions in the hotspots.},

We also related fragmentation of meadow with the morphodynamic state of the submerged beach (i.e. distinctive types of beach produced by the topography, the wave climate and the sediment composition) in order to investigate the inﬂuence of one natural component on the seagrass meadow seascape. Results demonstrated that fragmentation in the P. oceanica meadows is strongly inﬂuenced by the human component, being lower in natural meadows than in anthropized ones, and that it is little inﬂuenced by the morphodynamic state of the coast. The use of landscape approaches to discriminate natural disturbance from human impacts that affect seagrass meadows is thus recommended for the proper management of coastal zones.},

	abstract = {Underwater photogrammetry has been increasingly used to study and monitor the three-dimensional characteristics of marine habitats, despite a lack of knowledge on the quality and reliability of the reconstructions. More particularly, little attention has been paid to exploring and estimating the relative contribution of multiple acquisition parameters on the model resolution (distance between neighbor vertices), accuracy (closeness to true positions/measures) and precision (variability of positions/measures). On the other hand, some studies used expensive or cumbersome camera systems that can restrict the number of users of this technology for the monitoring of marine habitats. This study aimed at developing a simple and cost-effective protocol able to produce accurate and reproducible high-resolution models. Precisely, the effect of the camera system, ﬂying elevation, camera orientation and number of images on the resolution and accuracy of marine habitat reconstructions was tested through two experiments. A ﬁrst experiment allowed for testing all combinations of acquisition parameters through the building of 192 models of the same 36 m2 study site. The ﬂying elevation and camera system strongly affected the model resolution, while the photo density mostly affected bundle adjustment accuracy and total processing time. The camera orientation, in turn, mostly affected the reprojection error. The best combination of parameters was used in a second experiment to assess the accuracy and precision of the resulting reconstructions. The average model resolution was 3.4 mm, and despite a decreasing precision in the positioning of markers with distance to the model center (0.33, 0.27, and 1.2 mm/m Standard Deviation (SD) in X, Y, Z, respectively), the measures were very accurate and precise: 0.08\% error ± 0.06 SD for bar lengths, 0.36\% ± 0.51 SD for a rock model area and 0.92\% ± 0.54 SD for its volume. The 3D geometry of the rock only differed by 1.2 mm ± 0.8 SD from the ultra-high resolution in-air reference. These results suggest that this simple and cost-effective protocol produces accurate and reproducible models that are suitable for the study and monitoring of marine habitats at a small reef scale.},

	abstract = {Coralligenous assemblages represent the unique calcareous formations of biogenic origin in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite their importance in terms of biodiversity and biomass production, community analyses remain scarce. Actual sampling of these assemblages is complicated to carry out because their depth distribution (down to − 120 m) necessitates complex diving logistics. We highlight a rapid, cost-effective, objective and accurate method for the sampling of coralligenous assemblages and tested its efﬁciency in delineating a depth gradient. We compared seven photographic methods for estimating the percentage cover of sessile organisms: visual estimates (VS) with the aid of a 25, 64 or 100 square-grid and random-pointquadrats (RQ) with 25, 64 or 100 random points or 64 stratiﬁed random points. Comparisons were made using two simulated quadrats for which percent cover values were known. RQ with 64 random points was the method that accumulated the highest number of advantages. Using this method, two ﬁeld sites were sampled by divers at three depths (− 50, − 60 and − 70 m) with increasing replication (10, 20, 30 and 40 photographic quadrats). The communities deduced from the 30 and 40 photos were similar. Community analyses showed an effect of depth nested in site on the assemblages observed. With increasing depth, encrusting algae get replaced by Porifera. Dissimilarity between − 50 m and − 60 m/− 70 m was mainly due to Crambe tailliezi abundance. This methodology will be a useful tool for managers and administrators; it guarantees fast abundance estimation, non-destructive repeated sampling, the possibility of comparison among researchers and the permanent record of deep-sea communities.},

For the patchbased CNN approaches, we use image data extracted from underwater video accompanied by individual point-wise ground truth annotations. We show that patch-based CNN methods can outperform a previously proposed approach that uses support vector machine (SVM)-based classiﬁers in conjunction with texture-based features. We compare the results of ﬁve different CNN architectures in our formulation of patch-based CNN methods. The Resnet152 CNN architecture is observed to perform the best on our annotated dataset of underwater coral reef images. We also examine and compare the results of four different FCNN models for semantic segmentation of coral reef images. We develop a tool for fast generation of segmentation maps to serve as ground truth segmentations for our FCNN models. The FCNN architecture Deeplab v2 is observed to yield the best results for semantic segmentation of underwater coral reef images.},

	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for ﬁrst-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the inﬁnity norm.},

A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which makes training easier and improves generalization.

However, much image analysis is conducted manually, which is both time consuming and prone to error. As a result, valuable scientiﬁc data from many domains sit dormant in image libraries awaiting annotation. This work addresses one such domain: coral reef coverage estimation. In this setting, the goal, as deﬁned by coral reef ecologists, is to determine the percentage of the reef surface covered by rock, sand, algae, and corals; it is often desirable to resolve these taxa at the genus level or below. This is challenging since the data exhibit signiﬁcant within class variation, the borders between classes are complex, and the viewpoints and image quality vary. We introduce Moorea Labeled Corals, a large multiyear dataset with 400,000 expert annotations, to the computer vision community, and argue that this type of ecological data provides an excellent opportunity for performance benchmarking. We also propose a novel algorithm using texture and color descriptors over multiple scales that outperforms commonly used techniques from the texture classiﬁcation literature. We show that the proposed algorithm accurately estimates coral coverage across locations and years, thereby taking a signiﬁcant step towards reliable automated coral reef image annotation.},

	abstract = {Global climate change and other anthropogenic stressors have heightened the need to rapidly characterize ecological changes in marine benthic communities across large scales. Digital photography enables rapid collection of survey images to meet this need, but the subsequent image annotation is typically a time consuming, manual task. We investigated the feasibility of using automated point-annotation to expedite cover estimation of the 17 dominant benthic categories from survey-images captured at four Pacific coral reefs. Interand intra- annotator variability among six human experts was quantified and compared to semi- and fully- automated annotation methods, which are made available at coralnet.ucsd. edu. Our results indicate high expert agreement for identification of coral genera, but lower agreement for algal functional groups, in particular between turf algae and crustose coralline algae. This indicates the need for unequivocal definitions of algal groups, careful training of multiple annotators, and enhanced imaging technology. Semi-automated annotation, where 50\% of the annotation decisions were performed automatically, yielded cover estimate errors comparable to those of the human experts. Furthermore, fully-automated annotation yielded rapid, unbiased cover estimates but with increased variance. These results show that automated annotation can increase spatial coverage and decrease time and financial outlay for image-based reef surveys.},

The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen’s kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen’s suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

In this paper we propose a method to construct a selective classiﬁer given a trained neural network. Our method allows a user to set a desired risk level. At test time, the classiﬁer rejects instances as needed, to grant the desired risk (with high probability). Empirical results over CIFAR and ImageNet convincingly demonstrate the viability of our method, which opens up possibilities to operate DNNs in mission-critical applications. For example, using our method an unprecedented 2\% error in top-5 ImageNet classiﬁcation can be guaranteed with probability 99.9\%, and almost 60\% test coverage.},

We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-ofthe-art architectures with image and document classiﬁcation datasets.

In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs –extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacriﬁcing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classiﬁcation, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and ﬁnish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

The proposed method uses completed local binary pattern (CLBP), grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Gabor filter response, and opponent angle and hue channel color histograms as feature descriptors. For classification, either knearest neighbor (KNN), neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM) or probability density weighted mean distance (PDWMD) is used. The combination of features and classifiers that attains the best results is presented together with the guidelines for selection. The accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method are compared with other state-of-the-art techniques using three benthic and three texture datasets. The proposed method achieves the highest overall classification accuracy of any of the tested methods and has moderate execution time.

ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 5001000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classiﬁcation and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

For learning such saliency models, we introduce a neural network architecture, which has fully connected layers on top of CNNs responsible for feature extraction at three different scales. The penultimate layer of our neural network has been conﬁrmed to be a discriminative high-level feature vector for saliency detection, which we call deep contrast feature. To generate a more robust feature, we integrate handcrafted low-level features with our deep contrast feature. To promote further research and evaluation of visual saliency models, we also construct a new large database of 4447 challenging images and their pixelwise saliency annotations.

The challenge has been run annually from 2010 to present, attracting participation from more than ﬁfty institutions. This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances in object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the ﬁeld of large-scale image classiﬁcation and object detection, and compare the state-ofthe-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the 5 years of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements.},

Other models such as neural nets and bagged trees do not have these biases and predict well calibrated probabilities. We experiment with two ways of correcting the biased probabilities predicted by some learning methods: Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression. We qualitatively examine what kinds of distortions these calibration methods are suitable for and quantitatively examine how much data they need to be effective. The empirical results show that after calibration boosted trees, random forests, and SVMs predict the best probabilities.},

	abstract = {Despite the great contribution of coralligenous communities to Mediterranean biodiversity (second key-ecosystem after Posidonia oceanica meadows), they were never considered in the establishment of multimetric indices for ecological status assessment of marine environment. In this paper, we describe a method to evaluate the ecological status of coralligenous assemblages along Mediterranean French coasts. Several metrics were selected from literature for coralligenous assemblage description and include functional and structural information: percent cover of visible non-vagile species (using photographic quadrats along a transect) and gorgonian demography. Thirty eight ﬁeld stations were sampled for these metrics in PACA (Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur) region in June 2010 and considered for their morphology (bank, rim), geographical orientation and principal current direction (North, East, West, South) and depth (from −30 to −84 m). Metrics found to be linked to human pressures using ANCOVA and multiple correlation matrix were selected to be included in the index. The index (Coralligenous Assemblage Index, CAI) that we proposed was based on three selected metrics (Bryozoa percent cover, sludge percent cover, builder species percent cover) and considers depth; it was positively and signiﬁcantly linked to anthropization (related to water quality). The 38 stations studied with theoretically good to bad environmental conditions were classiﬁed in levels of status in accordance with our ﬁeld work knowledge. CAI variation was validated with three stations sampled with 30 other photos. This index could be an effective tool for the assessment of the ecological quality of coralligenous communities. It could be applied in the context of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive as well as in conservation and sustainable management of the marine environment.},

@article{yosinski_how_2014,
	title = {How transferable are features in deep neural networks?},
	abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the ﬁrst layer they learn features similar to Gabor ﬁlters and color blobs. Such ﬁrst-layer features appear not to be speciﬁc to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to speciﬁc by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus speciﬁcity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difﬁculties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A ﬁnal surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after ﬁne-tuning to the target dataset.},

To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efﬁcient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overﬁtting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant.

	volume = {41},
	abstract = {Sedimentation is a widespread and increasing process on most rocky coasts. The literature on its effects is reviewed and support is found for the general conclusion that sedimentation is an important ecological factor for hard bottom organisms. Sediments deeply affect the composition, structure and dynamics of rocky coast assemblages, and increased sediment load as a consequence of anthropogenic activities can be a threat to their diversity and functioning. Sediments that accumulate on rocky substrata are important agents of stress and disturbance. They can cause burial, scour and profound modiﬁcations to the characteristics of the bottom surface, and interact with other important physical and biological processes. The effects of sedimentation are complex, because they involve both direct outcomes on settlement, recruitment, growth or survival of individual species and indirect outcomes through mediation of competitive and/or predator–prey interactions. Not all species and assemblages are equally affected by sedimentation and responses vary over space and time, depending on the characteristics of the depositional environment, life histories of species and the stage of development of individuals and assemblages, and in relation to variable physical factors, including hydrodynamics, light intensity and bottom topography. Recent studies have much improved our ability to detect and understand the effects of sedimentation on rocky coast assemblages. However, little is still known about the underlying mechanisms. Overall, our present ability to make generalisations and predictions is limited by a paucity of quantitative and experimental research, and by the scant attention devoted to measuring the regime of perturbation by sediments and responses of organisms at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Predicting the magnitude of the effects that different sedimentation regimes have on rocky coast organisms and the critical levels above which detrimental effects become manifest remains a key issue for the ecology of rocky coasts and a challenge for future studies.},

	abstract = {Scene recognition is one of the hallmark tasks of computer vision, allowing deﬁnition of a context for object recognition. Whereas the tremendous recent progress in object recognition tasks is due to the availability of large datasets like ImageNet and the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning high-level features, performance at scene recognition has not attained the same level of success. This may be because current deep features trained from ImageNet are not competitive enough for such tasks. Here, we introduce a new scene-centric database called Places with over 7 million labeled pictures of scenes. We propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and show that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. Using CNN, we learn deep features for scene recognition tasks, and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets. A visualization of the CNN layers’ responses allows us to show differences in the internal representations of object-centric and scene-centric networks.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146},
	abstract = {Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efﬁciency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layerdeep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR, SVHN, COCO, and signiﬁcant improvements on ImageNet.

	title = {Generalized {Zero}-{Shot} {Learning} with {Deep} {Calibration} {Network}},
	abstract = {A technical challenge of deep learning is recognizing target classes without seen data. Zero-shot learning leverages semantic representations such as attributes or class prototypes to bridge source and target classes. Existing standard zero-shot learning methods may be prone to overﬁtting the seen data of source classes as they are blind to the semantic representations of target classes. In this paper, we study generalized zero-shot learning that assumes accessible to target classes for unseen data during training, and prediction on unseen data is made by searching on both source and target classes. We propose a novel Deep Calibration Network (DCN) approach towards this generalized zero-shot learning paradigm, which enables simultaneous calibration of deep networks on the conﬁdence of source classes and uncertainty of target classes. Our approach maps visual features of images and semantic representations of class prototypes to a common embedding space such that the compatibility of seen data to both source and target classes are maximized. We show superior accuracy of our approach over the state of the art on benchmark datasets for generalized zero-shot learning, including AwA, CUB, SUN, and aPY.},

	abstract = {We compiled published data in peer-review articles and grey literature reports, which we appended with our own data, to assess the changes in areal extent, cover and shoot density that P. oceanica meadows have experienced between years 1842 and 2009 in the Mediterranean basin. Our results demonstrate an overall tendency towards decline of the areal extent, cover and shoot density of P. oceanica meadows during the last 50 years, the period with the largest availability of records. Available estimates indicated that between 13\% and 50\% of seagrass areal extent of P. oceanica in the Mediterranean basin appear to be lost, and that the remaining meadows of the Mediterranean may have thinned shoot density by 50\% for the last 20 years and have became more fragmented. Considering the changes quantiﬁed in P. oceanica areal extent, cover and density, about 6.9\% of the potential P. oceanica vegetation would have been lost annually over the last 50 years. The loss of P. oceanica meadows in the Mediterranean may have lead to a substantial (between 11\% and 52\%) reduction of the capacity of this key coastal ecosystem to sequester carbon in the last 50 years, hence reducing the carbon sink capacity of the entire Mediterranean Sea. The major causes of P. oceanica loss were widespread local disturbances, but recently, global disturbances, such as climate change and the spread of invasive exotic species, were also seriously threatening Posidonia meadows in the Mediterranean. These ﬁndings urgently call for implementation of management measures aiming at mitigating coastal deterioration by combining local and global actions.},

	abstract = {A longstanding question in computer vision concerns the representation of 3D shapes for recognition: should 3D shapes be represented with descriptors operating on their native 3D formats, such as voxel grid or polygon mesh, or can they be effectively represented with view-based descriptors? We address this question in the context of learning to recognize 3D shapes from a collection of their rendered views on 2D images. We ﬁrst present a standard CNN architecture trained to recognize the shapes’ rendered views independently of each other, and show that a 3D shape can be recognized even from a single view at an accuracy far higher than using state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors. Recognition rates further increase when multiple views of the shapes are provided. In addition, we present a novel CNN architecture that combines information from multiple views of a 3D shape into a single and compact shape descriptor offering even better recognition performance. The same architecture can be applied to accurately recognize human hand-drawn sketches of shapes. We conclude that a collection of 2D views can be highly informative for 3D shape recognition and is amenable to emerging CNN architectures and their derivatives.},

However, ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation remains a major challenge due to the annotation cost of large numbers of ﬁnegrained categories. This project shows that compelling classiﬁcation performance can be achieved on such categories even without labeled training data. Given image and class embeddings, we learn a compatibility function such that matching embeddings are assigned a higher score than mismatching ones; zero-shot classiﬁcation of an image proceeds by ﬁnding the label yielding the highest joint compatibility score. We use state-of-the-art image features and focus on different supervised attributes and unsupervised output embeddings either derived from hierarchies or learned from unlabeled text corpora. We establish a substantially improved state-of-the-art on the Animals with Attributes and Caltech-UCSD Birds datasets. Most encouragingly, we demonstrate that purely unsupervised output embeddings (learned from Wikipedia and improved with ﬁnegrained text) achieve compelling results, even outperforming the previous supervised state-of-the-art. By combining different output embeddings, we further improve results.},

	abstract = {Digital photography is widely used by coral reef monitoring programs to assess benthic status and trends. In addition to creating a permanent archive, photographic surveys can be rapidly conducted, which is important in environments where bottom-time is frequently limiting. However, substantial effort is required to manually analyze benthic images; which is expensive and leads to lags before data are available. Using previously analyzed imagery from NOAA’s Paciﬁc Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program, we assessed the capacity of a trained and widely used machine-learning image analysis tool – CoralNet coralnet.ucsd.edu – to generate fully-automated benthic cover estimates for the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) and American Samoa. CoralNet was able to generate estimates of site-level coral cover for both regions that were highly comparable to those generated by human analysts (Pearson’s r {\textgreater} 0.97, and with bias of 1\% or less). CoralNet was generally effective at estimating cover of common coral genera (Pearson’s r {\textgreater} 0.92 and with bias of 2\% or less in 6 of 7 cases), but performance was mixed for other groups including algal categories, although generally better for American Samoa than MHI. CoralNet performance was improved by simplifying the classiﬁcation scheme from genus to functional group and by training within habitat types, i.e., separately for coral-rich, pavement, boulder, or “other” habitats. The close match between humangenerated and CoralNet-generated estimates of coral cover pooled to the scale of island and year demonstrates that CoralNet is capable of generating data suitable for assessing spatial and temporal patterns. The imagery we used was gathered from sites randomly located in {\textless}30 m hard-bottom at multiple islands and habitat-types per region, suggesting our results are likely to be widely applicable. As image acquisition is relatively straightforward, the capacity of fully-automated image analysis tools to minimize the need for resource intensive human analysts opens possibilities for enormous increases in the quantity and consistency of coral reef benthic data that could become available to researchers and managers.},
