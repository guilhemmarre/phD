	abstract = {Habitat complexity plays a major role in determining the distribution and structure of ﬁsh assemblages in the aquatic environment. These locations are critical for ecosystem function and have signiﬁcant implications for conservation and management. In this study, we evaluated the utility of remotely sensed lidar (light detection and ranging) data for deriving substrate rugosity (a measure of habitat complexity) on a coral reef in Hawaii. We also assessed the potential application of lidar data for examining the relationship between habitat complexity and Hawaiian reef ﬁsh assemblage characteristics. Lidar-derived rugosity (4 m grid size) was found to be highly correlated with in-situ rugosity and was concluded to be a viable method for measuring rugosity in analogous coral reef environments. We established that lidar-derived rugosity was a good predictor of ﬁsh biomass and demonstrated a strong relationship with several ﬁsh assemblage metrics in hard bottom habitat at multiple spatial resolutions. This research demonstrates (i) the efﬁcacy of lidar data to provide substrate rugosity measures at scales commensurate with the resources and their environment (ii) the applicability of lidar-derived rugosity for examining ﬁsh–habitat relationships on a coral reef in Hawaii and (iii) the potential of lidar to provide information about the seascape structure that can ultimately be used to prioritize areas for conservation and management.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean seagrasses have been hailed for their numerous ecosystem services, yet they are undergoing a decline in their coverage. The major complication with resolving this tendency is the sparsity of data on their overall distribution. This study addresses the suitability of the recently launched Sentinel-2 satellite for mapping the distribution of Mediterranean seagrass meadows. A comprehensive methodology is presented which applies atmospheric and analytical water column corrections and compares the performance of three diﬀerent supervised classiﬁers. Remote sensing of the Thermaikos Gulf, northwestern Aegean Sea (Greece, eastern Mediterranean Sea) reveals that the utilization of Support Vector Machines on water column corrected reﬂectances yields best accuracies. Two Mediterranean seagrasses, Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa, cover a total submerged area of 1.48 km2 between depths of 1.4–16.5 m. With its 10-m spatial resolution and 5-day revisit frequency, Sentinel-2 imagery can mitigate the Mediterranean seagrass distribution data gap and allow better management and conservation in the future in a retrospective, time- and cost-eﬀective fashion.},

	abstract = {Traditional surface area and volume quantiﬁcation techniques for scleractinian corals are often destructive or inaccurate. Therefore, non-destructive 3D scanning methods have been applied as minimally invasive alternative. However, it remains largely unknown how the reproducibility of the measurement is affected by the complexity of the coral colonies. It is also unclear how the scanning procedure (handling, exposure to air, and light of the scanner) impacts the corals’ health. In this study, we used a high-end handheld 3D scanner, which combines a structured-light with an image-based approach, to investigate the reproducibility of surface area and volume measurements as well as handling effects. Corals with different shape complexity, covering branching and massive species, were used as model organisms. The variance of repetitive scans ranged from 0.13\% to 1.31\% for volume and from 0.09\% to 0.58\% for surface area calculations. Linear regression models indicated that reproducibility decreases with increasing complexity of the coral. Excessive scanning caused an increase or decrease of growth rates, depending on the studied species. However, it did not impair coral health. We conclude that 3D scanning is a highly precise, reproducible, and minimally invasive method for coral surface area and volume measurements, which allows for quick processing of large datasets. Detailed technical recommendations for the application of 3D scanning in coral research are provided in the manuscript.},

This study determined whether 3D models of an ecologically relevant reef structure, the coral bommie, could be constructed using structure from motion and be reliably used to measure bommie volume and surface area between different observers and over time. We also determined whether the number of images used to construct a model had an impact on the ﬁnal measurements. Three dimensional models were constructed of over twenty coral bommies from Heron Island, a coral cay at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef. This study did not detect any signiﬁcant observer effect, and there were no signiﬁcant differences in measurements over four sampling days. The mean measurement error across all bommies and between observers was 15 ± 2\% for volume measurements and 12 ± 1\% for surface area measurements. There was no relationship between the number of pictures taken for a reconstruction and the measurements from that model, however, more photographs were necessary to be able to reconstruct complete coral bommies larger than 1 m3. These results suggest that structure from motion is a viable tool for ongoing monitoring of ecologically-signiﬁcant coral reefs, especially to establish effects of disturbances, provided the measurement error is considered.},

This, however, renders data unnecessarily voluminous and causes issues. In this paper, we design a novel type of neural network that directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. Our network, named PointNet, provides a uniﬁed architecture for applications ranging from object classiﬁcation, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efﬁcient and effective. Empirically, it shows strong performance on par or even better than state of the art. Theoretically, we provide analysis towards understanding of what the network has learnt and why the network is robust with respect to input perturbation and corruption.},

	abstract = {Visual 3D reconstruction techniques provide rich ecological and habitat structural information from underwater imagery. However, an unaided swimmer or diver struggles to navigate precisely over larger extents with consistent image overlap needed for visual reconstruction. While underwater robots have demonstrated systematic coverage of areas much larger than the footprint of a single image, access to suitable robotic systems is limited and requires specialized operators. Furthermore, robots are poor at navigating hydrodynamic habitats such as shallow coral reefs. We present a simple approach that constrains the motion of a swimmer using a line unwinding from a fixed central drum. The resulting motion is the involute of a circle, a spiral-­like path with constant spacing between revolutions. We test this survey method at a broad range of habitats and hydrodynamic conditions encircling Lizard Island in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The approach generates fast, structured, repeatable, and large-­extent surveys ({\textasciitilde}110 m2 in 15 min) that can be performed with two people and are superior to the commonly used “mow the lawn” method. The amount of image overlap is a design parameter, allowing for surveys that can then be reliably used in an automated processing pipeline to generate 3D reconstructions, orthographically projected mosaics, and structural complexity indices. The individual images or full mosaics can also be labeled for benthic diversity and cover estimates. The survey method we present can serve as a standard approach to repeatedly collecting underwater imagery for high-­resolution 2D mosaics and 3D reconstructions covering spatial extents much larger than a single image footprint without requiring sophisticated robotic systems or lengthy deployment of visual guides. As such, it opens up cost-­effective novel observations to inform studies relating habitat structure to ecological processes and biodiversity at scales and spatial resolutions not readily available previously.},

However, the seagrass population is declining worldwide, and 30–40\% of the seagrass areas in the Philippines have been lost in the last 50 years. The quadrat method by scuba diving has been widely used to study seagrass distribution and measure dugong feeding trails. However, this method is affected by observational skills of the divers and the survey time is usually limited by air capacity in the tank and effort for high-resolution sampling. In this study, a new method of seagrass mapping and quantiﬁcation of dugong trail distribution is proposed and tested. The method produces clear and high-resolution data using acoustic and optical devices with high efﬁciency. The ﬁeld study was conducted at Mayo Bay, southeastern Philippines. Continuous optical images were taken using a water-proof digital still camera from the sea surface by a swimmer with snorkel. Using the software PhotoScan, 3D optical images were generated from the continuous photos. The resolution of the optical image is 2.96 ± 0.17 (SD) mm per pixel so that a leaf of Halophila sp. is identiﬁable. By counting the pixels of dugong trails, the feeding rates were calculated and the values were 13.5\% in the survey area 1 and 7.1\% in area 2. The quantiﬁcation method, based on high-resolution optical image generated by continuous photos, can be useful for assessing the status of the seagrass meadows and the distribution of dugong trails.},

In this work, motivations behind the need for systematic underwater calibrations are provided, then experimental tests using a specifically designed photogrammetric modular test object in laboratory and at sea are reported. The experiments are carried out using a Nikon D750 24 Mpx DSLR camera with a 24 mm f2.8 AF/D lens coupled with a NIMAR NI3D750ZM housing, equipped first with a dome and, successively, with a flat port. To quantify the degradation of image quality, MTF measurements are carried out, then the outcomes of self-calibrating bundle adjustment calibrations are shown and commented. Optical phenomena like field curvature as well as chromatic aberration and astigmatism are analysed and their implications on the degradation of image quality is factored in the bundle adjustment through a different weighting of 2D image observations.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of Earth surface processes is rapidly advancing as new remote sensing technologies such as LiDAR and close-range digital photogrammetry become more accessible and affordable. A very-high spatial resolution digital terrain model (DTM) and orthophoto mosaic (mm scale) were produced using close-range digital photogrammetry based on ‘Structure-from-Motion’ (SfM) algorithms for a 250 m transect along a shallow coral reef ﬂat on Heron Reef, Great Barrier Reef. The precise terrain data were used to characterise surface roughness, a critical factor affecting ecological and physical processes on the reef. Three roughness parameters, namely the root mean square height, tortuosity (or rugosity) and fractal dimension, were derived and compared in order to asses which one better characterises reef ﬂat roughness. The typical relief across the shallow reef ﬂat was 0.1 m with a maximum value of 0.42 m. Coral reef terrain roughness, as characterised by the three chosen parameters, generally increased towards the middle of the transect where live coral covers most of the reef ﬂat and decreases towards the edges of the transect. The fractal dimension (values ranging from 2.2 to 2.59) best characterised reef roughness, as evidenced by a closer agreement with the distribution of known coral benthic substrates. This is the ﬁrst study quantifying scale-independent roughness of a coral reef at benthic and biotope/patch levels (cm-m). The readily available and cost-effective methods presented are highly appropriate for data collection, processing and analysis to generate very-high spatial resolution DTMs and orthophoto mosaics of shallow and energetic coral reefs.},

	abstract = {One of the main obstacles for biological assessments of coral reefs over large spatial scales is the ability to link data obtained at the laboratory scale to spatially large data sets. This is particularly the case when trying to assess the ecological function of microbial processes following dramatic large-scale events such as mass coral bleaching. To be able to infer ecological function of ﬁeld corals from laboratory measurement standardised to surface area it is imperative to be able to measure the actual surface area of corals in-situ. There have been several approaches proposed to estimate the three-dimensional surface area of ﬁeld corals. While these have been shown to be reliable for simple coral growth forms, large degrees of error are introduced when applying them to complex growth forms. This paper reﬁnes a technique for calculating the three-dimensional surface area based on the projected surface area, with errors associated with complex growth forms reduced to b 5\%. Once developed, the simple mathematical relationship (called the surface index) can be used to estimate the three-dimensional surface area of ﬁeld corals from photograph or video imagery, allowing physiological parameters of corals determined at the sub-colony scale to whole colony and spatially large data sets of coral reefs. The effectiveness of using laser scanning techniques to derive threedimensional images of corals is also discussed.},

These models can be made easily accessible and shared among collaborators or researchers using the Internet. Here, we compare high cost and low cost technologies on coral skeletons as well as imaging phantoms for accurate reference. We generated 3D models that were compared. Even though CT scanning and photogrammetry are the most accurate methods the latter is far less costly. It also allows for texture mapping, an essential tool in the ﬁeld, and easy dataset handling. We submitted these 3D virtual models to experts for taxonomical identiﬁcation, and they identiﬁed all specimens accurately. Finally, we further discuss applicability of our approach on museum collections, living corals, and ﬁeld work.},

The accuracy of underwater 3D modelling is affected by more parameters than in single media cases. This study is part of a larger project on 3D measurements of temporal change of coral cover in tropical waters. It compares the accuracies of 3D point clouds generated by using images acquired from a system camera mounted in an underwater housing and the popular GoPro cameras respectively. A precisely measured calibration frame was placed in the target scene in order to provide accurate control information and also quantify the errors of the modelling procedure. In addition, several objects (cinder blocks) with various shapes were arranged in the air and underwater and 3D point clouds were generated by automated image matching. These were further used to examine the relative accuracy of the point cloud generation by comparing the point clouds of the individual objects with the objects measured by the system camera in air (the best possible values). Given a working distance of about 1.5 m, the GoPro camera can achieve a relative accuracy of 1.3 mm in air and 2.0 mm in water. The system camera achieved an accuracy of 1.8 mm in water, which meets our requirements for coral measurement in this system.},

While advances in remote sensing, integrative modelling and meta-analysis enable generalisations from ﬁeld observations, there is an underlying need for high-resolution, standardised and geo-referenced ﬁeld data. Here, we evaluate a new approach aimed at optimising data collection and analysis to assess broad-scale patterns of coral reef community composition using automatically annotated underwater imagery, captured along 2 km transects. We validate this approach by investigating its ability to detect spatial (e.g., across regions) and temporal (e.g., over years) change, and by comparing automated annotation errors to those of multiple human annotators. Our results indicate that change of coral reef benthos can be captured at high resolution both spatially and temporally, with an average error below 5\%, among key benthic groups. Cover estimation errors using automated annotation varied between 2\% and 12\%, slightly larger than human errors (which varied between 1\% and 7\%), but small enough to detect signiﬁcant changes among dominant groups. Overall, this approach allows a rapid collection of in-situ observations at larger spatial scales (km) than previously possible, and provides a pathway to link, calibrate, and validate broader analyses across even larger spatial scales (10–10,000 km2).},

No seasonal pattern in growth or shrinkage was found for either species. M. alternans grew and shrank at signiﬁcantly higher rates than L. frondosum. Growth rates for both species were over an order of magnitude lower than those previously reported for other Mediterranean and tropical species, and were similar to reports for crustose corallines in Arctic and temperate waters. Almost 50 \% of monitored M. alternans thalli underwent at least one ﬁssion or fusion event over the 2 year monitoring period, while in L. frondosum these events were rarely observed. Interspeciﬁc diﬀerences in rates of growth, shrinkage, ﬁssion and fusion appear to depend on diﬀerences in thallus thickness (M. alternans is thin and L. frondosum is thick). These diﬀerences were interpreted as distinct biological strategies of persistence and the occupation of primary substratum.},

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates how multi-scale measures of rugosity, slope and aspect can be derived from fine-scale bathymetric reconstructions created from geo-referenced stereo imagery. We generate three-dimensional reconstructions over large spatial scales using data collected by Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), manned submersibles and diver-held imaging systems. We propose a new method for calculating rugosity in a Delaunay triangulated surface mesh by projecting areas onto the plane of best fit using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Slope and aspect can be calculated with very little extra effort, and fitting a plane serves to decouple rugosity from slope. We compare the results of the virtual terrain complexity calculations with experimental results using conventional in-situ measurement methods. We show that performing calculations over a digital terrain reconstruction is more flexible, robust and easily repeatable. In addition, the method is non-contact and provides much less environmental impact compared to traditional survey techniques. For diver-based surveys, the time underwater needed to collect rugosity data is significantly reduced and, being a technique based on images, it is possible to use robotic platforms that can operate beyond diver depths. Measurements can be calculated exhaustively at multiple scales for surveys with tens of thousands of images covering thousands of square metres. The technique is demonstrated on data gathered by a diver-rig and an AUV, on small single-transect surveys and on a larger, dense survey that covers over 3,750 m2. Stereo images provide 3D structure as well as visual appearance, which could potentially feed into automated classification techniques. Our multi-scale rugosity, slope and aspect measures have already been adopted in a number of marine science studies. This paper presents a detailed description of the method and thoroughly validates it against traditional in-situ measurements.},

Recent developments of new habitatmapping techniques make this advice more achievable, but the success of such an approach depends largely on our ability to define habitat types in a way that is ecologically relevant. We devised and tested the ecological relevance of a set of habitat-type definitions through our participation in a stakeholder-driven process to design a network of MPAs, focusing on no-take marine reserves in the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve, San Andr´es Archipelago, Colombia. A priori definitions of habitat types were ecologically relevant, in that our habitat-type definitions corresponded to identifiable and unique characteristics in the ecological communities found there. The identification of ecological pathways and connectivity among habitats also helped in designing ecologically relevant reserve boundaries. Our findings contributed to the overall design process, along with our summary of other general principles of marine reserve design. Extensive stakeholder input provided information concerning the resources and their patterns of use. These inputs also contributed to the reserve design process. We anticipate success for the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve at achieving conservation and social goals because its zoning process includes detailed yet flexible scientific advice and the participation of stakeholders at every step.},

Remote sensing applications have progressed signiﬁcantly and photogrammetry together with application of structure from motion software is emerging as a leading technique to create three-dimensional (3D) models of corals and reefs from which biophysical properties of structural complexity can be quantiﬁed. This enables the addressing of a range of important marine research questions, such as what the role of habitat complexity is in driving key ecological processes (i.e., foraging). Yet, it is essential to assess the accuracy and precision of photogrammetric measurements to support their application in mapping, monitoring and quantifying coral reef form and structure. This study evaluated the precision (by repeated modeling) and accuracy (by comparison with laser reference models) of geometry and structural complexity metrics derived from photogrammetric 3D models of marine benthic habitat at two ecologically relevant spatial extents; individual coral colonies of a range of common morphologies and patches of reef area of 100s of square metres. Surface rugosity measurements were generally precise across all morphologies and spatial extents with average differences in the geometry of replicate models of 1–6 mm for coral colonies and 25 mm for the reef area. Precision decreased with complexity of the coral morphology, with metrics for small massive corals being the most precise (1\% coefﬁcient of variation (CV) in surface rugosity) and metrics for bottlebrush corals being the least precise (10\% CV in surface rugosity). There was no indication however that precision was related to complexity for the patch-scale modelling. The 3D geometry of coral models differed by only 1–3 mm from laser reference models. However, high spatial variation in these differences around the model led to a consistent underestimation of surface rugosity values for all morphs of between 8\% and 37\%. This study highlights the utility of several off-the-shelf photogrammetry tools for the measurement of structural complexity across a range of scales relevant to ecologist and managers. It also provides important information on the accuracy and precision of these systems which should allow for their targeted use by non-experts in computer vision within these contexts.},

	abstract = {Ecological habitats with greater structural complexity contain more species due to increased niche diversity. This is especially apparent on coral reefs where individual coral colonies aggregate to give a reef its morphology, species zonation, and three dimensionality. Structural complexity is classically measured with a reef rugosity index, which is the ratio of a straight line transect to the distance a flexible chain of equal length travels when draped over the reef substrate; yet, other techniques from visual categories to remote sensing have been used to characterize structural complexity at scales from microhabitats to reefscapes. Reef-scale methods either lack quantitative precision or are too time consuming to be routinely practical, while remotely sensed indices are mismatched to the finer scale morphology of coral colonies and reef habitats. In this communication a new digital technique, Digital Reef Rugosity (DRR) is described which utilizes a self-contained water level gauge enabling a diver to quickly and accurately characterize rugosity with non-invasive millimeter scale measurements of coral reef surface height at decimeter intervals along meter scale transects. The precise measurements require very little post-processing and are easily imported into a spreadsheet for statistical analyses and modeling. To assess its applicability we investigated the relationship between DRR and fish community structure at four coral reef sites on Menjangan Island off the northwest corner of Bali, Indonesia and one on mainland Bali to the west of Menjangan Island; our findings show a positive relationship between DRR and fish diversity. Since structural complexity drives key ecological processes on coral reefs, we consider that DRR may become a useful quantitative community-level descriptor to characterize reef complexity.},

The three-dimensional (3D) size and structure of corals are directly related to many ecosystem values and functions. Most methods to estimate colony surface area have been limited to laboratory settings and cannot be used for field corals. Photographic methods for digital 3D reconstruction were applied here to determine the accuracy of three different approaches for estimating colony surface area of field corals from simple underwater measurements. The approaches include a volumetric size-class method, a hemispherical surrogate and a suite of log–linear models generated from stepwise multiple regression analyses of digitallyreconstructed colonies. For each approach, surface area values were calculated from field measurements of colony size and the accuracy was determined by comparison with digitally-derived values for the same colonies. Accuracy varied among approaches; log–linear models (12\% difference) were most accurate, followed by the hemispherical surrogate (17\% difference) and size-classes (40\% difference). The log–linear and hemispherical surrogate approaches are potentially applicable to at least nine common coral species. The photographic reconstruction method, although time-consuming and not intended for routine application, was shown by comparison with laser-scanned images to provide a highly accurate method for determining 3D colony surface area.},

	abstract = {Habitat structural complexity is one of the most important factors in determining the makeup of biological communities. Recent advances in structure-­from-­motion and photogrammetry have resulted in a proliferation of 3D digital representations of habitats from which structural complexity can be measured. Little attention has been paid to quantifying the measurement errors associated with these techniques, including the variability of results under different surveying and environmental conditions. Such errors have the potential to confound studies that compare habitat complexity over space and time. This study evaluated the accuracy, precision, and bias in measurements of marine habitat structural complexity derived from structure-­from-­motion and photogrammetric measurements using repeated surveys of artificial reefs (with known structure) as well as natural coral reefs. We quantified measurement errors as a function of survey image coverage, actual surface rugosity, and the morphological community composition of the habitat-­forming organisms (reef corals). Our results indicated that measurements could be biased by up to 7.5\% of the total observed ranges of structural complexity based on the environmental conditions present during any particular survey. Positive relationships were found between measurement errors and actual complexity, and the strength of these relationships was increased when coral morphology and abundance were also used as predictors. The numerous advantages of structure-­from-­motion and photogrammetry techniques for quantifying and investigating marine habitats will mean that they are likely to replace traditional measurement techniques (e.g., chain-­and-t­ ape). To this end, our results have important implications for data collection and the interpretation of measurements when examining changes in habitat complexity using structure-­from-­motion and photogrammetry.},

This review provides an overview of the results obtained by the main studies dealing with these formations, including the environmental factors which inﬂuence the development of coralligenous communities, their distribution, types, assemblages, builders and eroders, the biotic relationships and processes that create and destroy coralligenous assemblages, their dynamics and seasonality, and the functioning of several outstanding and key species. Special attention is devoted to the biodiversity of coralligenous communities and a ﬁrst estimation of the number of species reported for this habitat is provided. Major disturbances affecting coralligenous communities are discussed, ranging from large-scale events that are probably related to global environmental changes to degradation by waste water or invasive species. Degradation by ﬁshing activities and by divers is also considered. Finally, the main gaps in current scientiﬁc knowledge of coralligenous communities are listed and some recommendations are made regarding their protection.},

	abstract = {Photogrammetric methods for dense 3D surface reconstruction are increasingly available to both professional and amateur users who have requirements that span a wide variety of applications. One of the key concerns in choosing an appropriate method is to understand the achievable accuracy and how choices made within the workﬂow can alter that outcome. In this paper we consider accuracy in two components: the ability to generate a correctly scaled 3D model; and the ability to automatically deliver a high quality data set that provides good agreement to a reference surface. The determination of scale information is particularly important, since a network of images usually only provides angle measurements and thus leads to unscaled geometry. A solution is the introduction of known distances in object space, such as base lines between camera stations or distances between control points. In order to avoid using known object distances, the method presented in this paper exploits a calibrated stereo camera utilizing the calibrated base line information from the camera pair as an observational based geometric constraint. The method provides distance information throughout the object volume by orbiting the object.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, significant efforts have been made to describe fish-habitat associations. However, most studies have oversimplified actual connections between fish assemblages and their habitats by using univariate correlations. The purpose of this study was to identify the features of habitat forming corals that facilitate and influences assemblages of associated species such as fishes. For this we developed threedimensional models of colonies of Acropora cervicornis to estimate geometry (length and height), structural complexity (i.e., volume, density of branches, etc.) and biological features of the colonies (i.e., live coral tissue, algae). We then correlated these colony characteristics with the associated fish assemblage using multivariate analyses. We found that geometry and complexity were better predictors of the structure of fish community, compared to other variables such as percentage of live coral tissue or algae. Combined, the geometry of each colony explained 40\% of the variability of the fish assemblage structure associated with this coral species; 61\% of the abundance and 69\% of fish richness, respectively. Our study shows that three-dimensional reconstructions of discrete colonies of Acropora cervicornis provides a useful description of the colonial structural complexity and may explain a great deal of the variance in the structure of the associated coral reef fish community. This demonstration of the strongly traitdependent ecosystem role of this threatened species has important implications for restoration and conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a stereo photogrammetry method that allows accurate measurements of volume for sessile epibenthic organisms. It represents a novel approach based on multiple views (five stereo image pairs) from a purpose built stereo digital still camera system combined with a three-dimensional reconstruction software program (CAM). The bias, accuracy, precision and efficiency of the method were assessed in the laboratory using models with three levels of morphological complexity (simple, moderate and complex morphologies) and two sizes (large and small). The technique did not show any biases to observer experience, with no significant difference among observers (p N 0.05). Volume measurements made with CAM were very accurate when compared with the water displacement volume of each model, with an overall mean error of about −3\% (S.E. ± 1\%). The CAM volume measurements were more accurate on complex models and moderately complex models than on models with simple morphologies. Also, large models had a higher accuracy than small models. Volume measurements made with CAM were also highly precise with the lowest precision observed being ±2\% of the volume estimate. The time required for a volume estimation using the CAM method was also highly efficient, and the longest time taken for a volume estimation was on average 1 h and 36 min, making it the fastest reported three-dimensional reconstruction method. In field applications, volume estimations of four sponges were all within the observed accuracy, precision and efficiency established during laboratory trials. The accuracy, precision and efficiency demonstrated by the CAM method make this technique highly suitable for routine measurements of the volume of sessile epibenthic organisms.},

Loss of structural complexity is linked to ecosystem declines in biodiversity and resilience. We developed new methods using underwater stereo-imagery spanning 4 years (2010–2013) to reconstruct 3D models of coral reef areas and quantiﬁed both structural complexity at two spatial resolutions (2.5 and 25 cm) and benthic community composition to characterize changes after an unprecedented thermal anomaly on the west coast of Australia in 2011. Structural complexity increased at both resolutions in quadrats (4 m2) that bleached, but not those that did not bleach. Changes in complexity were driven by species-speciﬁc responses to warming, highlighting the importance of identifying small-scale dynamics to disentangle ecological responses to disturbance. We demonstrate an effective, repeatable method for quantifying the relationship among community composition, structural complexity and ocean warming, improving predictions of the response of marine ecosystems to environmental change.},

	abstract = {Intertidal ecosystems have primarily been studied using field-based sampling; remote sensing offers the ability to collect data over large areas in a snapshot of time that could complement field-based sampling methods by extrapolating them into the wider spatial and temporal context. Conventional remote sensing tools (such as satellite and aircraft imaging) provide data at limited spatial and temporal resolutions and relatively high costs for small-scale environmental science and ecologically-focussed studies. In this paper, we describe a low-cost, kite-based imaging system and photogrammetric/ mapping procedure that was developed for constructing high-resolution, three-dimensional, multi-spectral terrain models of intertidal rocky shores. The processing procedure uses automatic image feature detection and matching, structure-frommotion and photo-textured terrain surface reconstruction algorithms that require minimal human input and only a small number of ground control points and allow the use of cheap, consumer-grade digital cameras. The resulting maps combine imagery at visible and near-infrared wavelengths and topographic information at sub-centimeter resolutions over an intertidal shoreline 200 m long, thus enabling spatial properties of the intertidal environment to be determined across a hierarchy of spatial scales. Results of the system are presented for an intertidal rocky shore at Jervis Bay, New South Wales, Australia. Potential uses of this technique include mapping of plant (micro- and macro-algae) and animal (e.g. gastropods) assemblages at multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

In this study, Worldview-2 (WV-2) imagery was combined with ﬁeld sampling to demonstrate the capability of mapping species type, percentage cover, and above-ground biomass of seagrasses in monsoonal southern Thailand. A high accuracy positioning technique, involving the Real Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), was used to record ﬁeld sample data positions and reduce uncertainties in matching locations between satellite and ﬁeld data sets. Our results showed high accuracy (90.67\%) in mapping seagrass distribution and moderate accuracies for mapping percentage cover and species type (73.74\% and 75.00\%, respectively). Seagrass species type mapping was successfully achieved despite discrimination confusion among Halophila ovalis, Thalassia hemprichii, and Enhalus acoroides species with greater than 50\% cover. The green, yellow, and near infrared spectral channels of WV-2 were used to estimate the above-ground biomass using a multiple linear regression model (RMSE of ˘10.38 g¨ DW/m2, R = 0.68). The average total above-ground biomass was 23.95 ˘ 10.38 g¨ DW/m2. The seagrass maps produced in this study are an important step towards measuring the attributes of seagrass biodiversity and can be used as inputs to seagrass dynamic models and conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Vegetation distribution information is crucial to the environmental protection of Gobi. The traditional method to obtain vegetation distribution information is building vegetation index which can be used as the threshold for vegetation recognition, with the spectral characteristics of vegetation in remote sensing images form satellite or aviation, especially the near infrared band. In recent years, low-altitude photogrammetry technology based on UAV has developed rapidly. But the UAV images do not contain near-infrared band information, many researchers have adopted visible light spectral characteristics to construct new vegetation index and achieved many progress. In this paper, taking the Gobi region of northwest China as a example, we intruduced the methods for multi-scale segmentation and classification of DOM which generated from the UAV images. Further, based on eCognition Developer, we extracted visible light-based vegetation indices including NGRDI, NGBDI, VDVI, GLI, and ExG, and assessed the vegetation recognition effect of these five indices.},

Changes in P. oceanica bed spatial distribution (limits and extent) during these 85 years were analyzed in terms of concordance (remaining areas), positive discordance (expanding areas) or negative discordance (lost areas). Lost areas were linked with direct or indirect impacts of coastal development (artiﬁcialized coastlines (namely harbours, ports of refuge, landﬁlls, artiﬁcial beaches, groynes and pontoons, submarine pipelines and aquatic farms) visible on the photographs. The comparison showed that 73\% of the shallow limits have declined. Considering spatial extent, remaining seagrass meadows areas accounted for the major part (85\%), while lost areas accounted for 13\% and expanding areas for 1.1\%. Lost areas were mainly linked with artiﬁcial coastlines but 44\% remained with undetermined causes (invisible pressures and/or mixed effects). The analysis of 96 coastal facilities creating the artiﬁcial (namely man-made) coastlines showed that the highest impact over the longest distance (5 km) was caused by harbours. Only artiﬁcial beaches had such a distant impact. Pontoons were the least surrounded by lost seagrass meadows areas. These quantitative data offer important information for marine conservation.},

	abstract = {During the last ﬁfty years, there has been a dramatic increase in the development of anthropogenic activities, and this is particularly threatening to marine coastal ecosystems. The management of these multiple and simultaneous anthropogenic pressures requires reliable and precise data on their distribution, as well as information (data, modelling) on their potential eﬀects on sensitive ecosystems. Focusing on Posidonia oceanica beds, a threatened habitat-forming seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, we developed a statistical approach to study the complex relationship between human multiple activities and ecosystem status. We used Random Forest modelling to explain the degradation status of P. oceanica (deﬁned herein as the shift from seagrass bed to dead matte) as a function of depth and 10 anthropogenic pressures along the French Mediterranean coast (1700 km of coastline including Corsica). Using a 50 × 50 m grid cells dataset, we obtained a particularly accurate model explaining 71.3\% of the variance, with a Pearson correlation of 0.84 between predicted and observed values. Human-made coastline, depth, coastal population, urbanization, and agriculture were the best global predictors of P. oceanica's degradation status. Aquaculture was the least important predictor, although its local individual inﬂuence was among the highest. Non-linear relationship between predictors and seagrass beds status was detected with tipping points (i.e. thresholds) for all variables except agriculture and industrial eﬄuents. Using these tipping points, we built a map representing the coastal seagrass beds classiﬁed into four categories according to an increasing pressure gradient and its risk of phase shift. Our approach provides important information that can be used to help managers preserve this essential and endangered ecosystem.},

	volume = {22},
	abstract = {The Posidonia oceanica meadow constitutes a key ecosystem in the sublittoral zone of the Mediterranean, from both an ecological and physical equilibrium perspective. In addition, it harbors a very high species diversity. Posidonia oceanica beds are very sensitive to disturbances caused by human activity (e.g. coastal development, pollution, turbidity, anchoring, etc.) and their loss has been observed in a number of regions. The aim of the monitoring of P. oceanica meadows along the Provence and French Riviera coasts is (i) to evidence possible new losses and (ii) to evaluate through a biological indicator the efficiency of regional policies (e.g. setting up of sewage treatment plants, reduction in industrial and domestic pollution levels in the rivers flowing towards the Mediterranean, establishment of Marine Protected Areas, banning of new harbors and reclamations). Monitoring tools operate at three scales: (i) system scale (aerial photographs, measurement of bottom cover, permanent transects), (ii) meadow scale (e.g. photographs of Posidonia around cement markers positioned along meadow limits, shoot-density, permanent quadrats) and (iii) shoot scale (e.g. plagiotopic to orthotropic rhizome ratio, laying bare of the rhizomes, lepidochronology, leaf epiphytes, leaf biometry). Several monitoring programs are based on these tools, or some of them. The Posidonia Monitoring Network (PMN; RSP in French) is the most extensive. It was set-up in 1984 and concerns 33 survey sites. Between 1984 and 1999, the percentage of sites at which the P. oceanica meadow was seen to be in expansion increased from 21 to 42\%. This is consistent with the increase in the percentage of sewage which is processed in treatment plants, from less than 10\% in the early 1980s and close to 100\% today.},

Underwater 3D imaging by means of still or video cameras can allow a detailed analysis of the temporal evolution of these meadows, but also of the seafloor morphology and integrity. Video-photographic devices and open source software for acquiring and managing 3D optical data rapidly became more and more effective and economically viable, making underwater 3D mapping an easier task to carry out. 3D reconstruction of the underwater scene can be obtained with photogrammetric techniques that require just one or more digital cameras, also in stereo configuration.

In this paper we used a non-destructive photo mosaicing technology to quantify seagrass distribution and abundance, and explore beneﬁts of micro-cartographic analysis. Furthermore, the use of photogrammetric tools enhanced the method, which proved to be efﬁcient due to its use of low-cost instruments and its simplicity of implementation.

Three different methods are presented and compared for precision alignment of imagery maps collected over a range of time-scales from 12 hours to two years between dives. The ﬁrst method uses Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features computed over imagery mosaics to compute the relative translational offset between repeat dives. The second method employs scan-optimisation using the bathymetry generated via structure-from-motion thus capturing more stable features in the environment, lending itself to larger timescale registration. The third method uses mutual information optimisation to register imagery maps, providing robustness to changes in the colour and brightness of objects in an underwater scene across multiple years. Results are presented from ﬁeld data collected using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in sites across the Australian coast between 2009 and 2011.},

	abstract = {Seagrass habitats in subtidal coastal waters provide a variety of ecosystem functions and services and there is an increasing need to acquire information on spatial and temporal dynamics of this resource. Here, we explored the capability of IKONOS (IKO) data of high resolution (4 m) for mapping seagrass cover [submerged aquatic vegetation (\%SAV) cover] along the mid-western coast of Florida, USA. We also compared seagrass maps produced with IKO data with that obtained using the Landsat TM sensor with lower resolution (30 m). Both IKO and TM data, collected in October 2009, were preprocessed to calculate water depth invariant bands to normalize the effect of varying depth on bottom spectra recorded by the two satellite sensors and further the textural information was extracted from IKO data. Our results demonstrate that the high resolution IKO sensor produced a higher accuracy than the TM sensor in a three-class \% SAV cover classiﬁcation. Of note is that the OA of \%SAV cover mapping at our study area created with IKO data was 5–20\% higher than that from other studies published. We also examined the spatial distribution of seagrass over a spatial range of 4–240 m using the Ripley’s K function [L(d)] and IKO data that represented four different grain sizes [4 m (one IKO pixel), 8 m (2 × 2 IKO pixels), 12 m (3 × 3 IKO pixels), and 16 m (4 × 4 IKO pixels)] from moderate-dense seagrass cover along a set of six transects. The Ripley’s K metric repeatedly indicated that seagrass cover representing 4 m × 4 m pixels displayed a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern over distances of {\textless}4–8 m, and a random or slightly clustered pattern of cover over 9–240 m. The spatial pattern of seagrass cover created with the three additional grain sizes (i.e., 2 × 24 m IKO pixels, 3 × 34 m IKO pixels, and 4 × 4 m IKO pixels) show a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern across 4–32 m and a random or slightly clustered pattern across 33–240 m. Given the ﬁrst report on using satellite observations to quantify seagrass spatial patterns at a spatial scale from 4 m to 240 m, our novel analyses of moderate-dense SAV cover utilizing Ripley’s K function illustrate how data obtained from the IKO sensor revealed seagrass spatial information that would be undetected by the TM sensor with a 30 m pixel size. Use of the seagrass classiﬁcation scheme here, along with data from the IKO sensor with enhanced resolution, offers an opportunity to synoptically record seagrass cover dynamics at both small and large spatial scales.},

This information is needed for identifying priority conservation sites and to help coastal ecosystem managers and stakeholders to develop conservation strategies and design a resilient network of protected marine areas. The results were based on an object-based image analysis of 50 Landsat-8 satellite images. The time window of image acquisition was between June 2013 and July 2015. In total, the seagrass coverage in Greek waters was estimated at 2619 km2. The largest coverages of individual seagrass meadows were found around Lemnos Island (124 km2), Corfu Island (46 km2), and East Peloponnese (47 km2). The accuracy assessment of the detected areas was based on 62 Natura 2000 sites, for which habitat maps were available. The mean total accuracy for all 62 sites was estimated at 76.3\%.},

	abstract = {Nearly half the world’s vascular plant species and one-third of terrestrial vertebrates are endemic to 25 “hotspots” of biodiversity, each of which has at least 1500 endemic plant species. None of these hotspots have more than one-third of their pristine habitat remaining. Historically, they covered 12\% of the land’s surface, but today their intact habitat covers only 1.4\% of the land. As a result of this habitat loss, we expect many of the hotspot endemics to have either become extinct or—because much of the habitat loss is recent—to be threatened with extinction. We used World Conservation Union [IUCN] Red Lists to test this expectation. Overall, between one-half and two-thirds of all threatened plants and 57\% of all threatened terrestrial vertebrates are hotspot endemics. For birds and mammals, in general, predictions of extinction in the hotspots based on habitat loss match numbers of species independently judged extinct or threatened. In two classes of hotspots the match is not as close. On oceanic islands, habitat loss underestimates extinction because introduced species have driven extinctions beyond those caused by habitat loss on these islands. In large hotspots, conversely, habitat loss overestimates extinction, suggesting scale dependence (this effect is also apparent for plants). For reptiles, amphibians, and plants, many fewer hotspot endemics are considered threatened or extinct than we would expect based on habitat loss. This mismatch is small in temperate hotspots, however, suggesting that many threatened endemic species in the poorly known tropical hotspots have yet to be included on the IUCN Red Lists. We then asked in which hotspots the consequences of further habitat loss (either absolute or given current rates of deforestation) would be most serious. Our results suggest that the Eastern Arc and Coastal Forests of Tanzania-Kenya, Philippines, and Polynesia-Micronesia can least afford to lose more habitat and that, if current deforestation rates continue, the Caribbean, Tropical Andes, Philippines, Mesoamerica, Sundaland, Indo-Burma, Madagascar, and Chocó–Darién–Western Ecuador will lose the most species in the near future. Without urgent conservation intervention, we face mass extinctions in the hotspots.},

We tested the hypothesis that human impacts are the major factor responsible for habitat fragmentation in P. oceanica meadows contrasting fragmentation of meadows located in ‘‘anthropized’’ areas with that of meadows located in areas with low anthropization and considered as virtually ‘‘natural’’. We also related fragmentation of meadow with the morphodynamic state of the submerged beach (i.e. distinctive types of beach produced by the topography, the wave climate and the sediment composition) in order to investigate the inﬂuence of one natural component on the seagrass meadow seascape. Results demonstrated that fragmentation in the P. oceanica meadows is strongly inﬂuenced by the human component, being lower in natural meadows than in anthropized ones, and that it is little inﬂuenced by the morphodynamic state of the coast. The use of landscape approaches to discriminate natural disturbance from human impacts that affect seagrass meadows is thus recommended for the proper management of coastal zones.},

	abstract = {Underwater photogrammetry has been increasingly used to study and monitor the three-dimensional characteristics of marine habitats, despite a lack of knowledge on the quality and reliability of the reconstructions. More particularly, little attention has been paid to exploring and estimating the relative contribution of multiple acquisition parameters on the model resolution (distance between neighbor vertices), accuracy (closeness to true positions/measures) and precision (variability of positions/measures). On the other hand, some studies used expensive or cumbersome camera systems that can restrict the number of users of this technology for the monitoring of marine habitats. This study aimed at developing a simple and cost-effective protocol able to produce accurate and reproducible high-resolution models. Precisely, the effect of the camera system, ﬂying elevation, camera orientation and number of images on the resolution and accuracy of marine habitat reconstructions was tested through two experiments. A ﬁrst experiment allowed for testing all combinations of acquisition parameters through the building of 192 models of the same 36 m2 study site. The ﬂying elevation and camera system strongly affected the model resolution, while the photo density mostly affected bundle adjustment accuracy and total processing time. The camera orientation, in turn, mostly affected the reprojection error. The best combination of parameters was used in a second experiment to assess the accuracy and precision of the resulting reconstructions. The average model resolution was 3.4 mm, and despite a decreasing precision in the positioning of markers with distance to the model center (0.33, 0.27, and 1.2 mm/m Standard Deviation (SD) in X, Y, Z, respectively), the measures were very accurate and precise: 0.08\% error ± 0.06 SD for bar lengths, 0.36\% ± 0.51 SD for a rock model area and 0.92\% ± 0.54 SD for its volume. The 3D geometry of the rock only differed by 1.2 mm ± 0.8 SD from the ultra-high resolution in-air reference. These results suggest that this simple and cost-effective protocol produces accurate and reproducible models that are suitable for the study and monitoring of marine habitats at a small reef scale.},

	abstract = {Coralligenous assemblages represent the unique calcareous formations of biogenic origin in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite their importance in terms of biodiversity and biomass production, community analyses remain scarce. Actual sampling of these assemblages is complicated to carry out because their depth distribution (down to − 120 m) necessitates complex diving logistics. We highlight a rapid, cost-effective, objective and accurate method for the sampling of coralligenous assemblages and tested its efﬁciency in delineating a depth gradient. We compared seven photographic methods for estimating the percentage cover of sessile organisms: visual estimates (VS) with the aid of a 25, 64 or 100 square-grid and random-pointquadrats (RQ) with 25, 64 or 100 random points or 64 stratiﬁed random points. Comparisons were made using two simulated quadrats for which percent cover values were known. RQ with 64 random points was the method that accumulated the highest number of advantages. Using this method, two ﬁeld sites were sampled by divers at three depths (− 50, − 60 and − 70 m) with increasing replication (10, 20, 30 and 40 photographic quadrats). The communities deduced from the 30 and 40 photos were similar. Community analyses showed an effect of depth nested in site on the assemblages observed. With increasing depth, encrusting algae get replaced by Porifera. Dissimilarity between − 50 m and − 60 m/− 70 m was mainly due to Crambe tailliezi abundance. This methodology will be a useful tool for managers and administrators; it guarantees fast abundance estimation, non-destructive repeated sampling, the possibility of comparison among researchers and the permanent record of deep-sea communities.},

For the patchbased CNN approaches, we use image data extracted from underwater video accompanied by individual point-wise ground truth annotations. We show that patch-based CNN methods can outperform a previously proposed approach that uses support vector machine (SVM)-based classiﬁers in conjunction with texture-based features. We compare the results of ﬁve different CNN architectures in our formulation of patch-based CNN methods. The Resnet152 CNN architecture is observed to perform the best on our annotated dataset of underwater coral reef images. We also examine and compare the results of four different FCNN models for semantic segmentation of coral reef images. We develop a tool for fast generation of segmentation maps to serve as ground truth segmentations for our FCNN models. The FCNN architecture Deeplab v2 is observed to yield the best results for semantic segmentation of underwater coral reef images.},

	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for ﬁrst-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the inﬁnity norm.},

A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which makes training easier and improves generalization.

	abstract = {With the proliferation of digital cameras and automatic acquisition systems, scientists can acquire vast numbers of images for quantitative analysis. However, much image analysis is conducted manually, which is both time consuming and prone to error. As a result, valuable scientiﬁc data from many domains sit dormant in image libraries awaiting annotation. This work addresses one such domain: coral reef coverage estimation. In this setting, the goal, as deﬁned by coral reef ecologists, is to determine the percentage of the reef surface covered by rock, sand, algae, and corals; it is often desirable to resolve these taxa at the genus level or below. This is challenging since the data exhibit signiﬁcant within class variation, the borders between classes are complex, and the viewpoints and image quality vary. We introduce Moorea Labeled Corals, a large multiyear dataset with 400,000 expert annotations, to the computer vision community, and argue that this type of ecological data provides an excellent opportunity for performance benchmarking. We also propose a novel algorithm using texture and color descriptors over multiple scales that outperforms commonly used techniques from the texture classiﬁcation literature. We show that the proposed algorithm accurately estimates coral coverage across locations and years, thereby taking a signiﬁcant step towards reliable automated coral reef image annotation.},

	abstract = {Global climate change and other anthropogenic stressors have heightened the need to rapidly characterize ecological changes in marine benthic communities across large scales. Digital photography enables rapid collection of survey images to meet this need, but the subsequent image annotation is typically a time consuming, manual task. We investigated the feasibility of using automated point-annotation to expedite cover estimation of the 17 dominant benthic categories from survey-images captured at four Pacific coral reefs. Interand intra- annotator variability among six human experts was quantified and compared to semi- and fully- automated annotation methods, which are made available at coralnet.ucsd. edu. Our results indicate high expert agreement for identification of coral genera, but lower agreement for algal functional groups, in particular between turf algae and crustose coralline algae. This indicates the need for unequivocal definitions of algal groups, careful training of multiple annotators, and enhanced imaging technology. Semi-automated annotation, where 50\% of the annotation decisions were performed automatically, yielded cover estimate errors comparable to those of the human experts. Furthermore, fully-automated annotation yielded rapid, unbiased cover estimates but with increased variance. These results show that automated annotation can increase spatial coverage and decrease time and financial outlay for image-based reef surveys.},

The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen’s kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen’s suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

In this paper we propose a method to construct a selective classiﬁer given a trained neural network. Our method allows a user to set a desired risk level. At test time, the classiﬁer rejects instances as needed, to grant the desired risk (with high probability). Empirical results over CIFAR and ImageNet convincingly demonstrate the viability of our method, which opens up possibilities to operate DNNs in mission-critical applications. For example, using our method an unprecedented 2\% error in top-5 ImageNet classiﬁcation can be guaranteed with probability 99.9\%, and almost 60\% test coverage.},

We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-ofthe-art architectures with image and document classiﬁcation datasets.

In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs –extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacriﬁcing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classiﬁcation, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and ﬁnish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

The proposed method uses completed local binary pattern (CLBP), grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Gabor filter response, and opponent angle and hue channel color histograms as feature descriptors. For classification, either knearest neighbor (KNN), neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM) or probability density weighted mean distance (PDWMD) is used. The combination of features and classifiers that attains the best results is presented together with the guidelines for selection. The accuracy and efficiency of our proposed method are compared with other state-of-the-art techniques using three benthic and three texture datasets. The proposed method achieves the highest overall classification accuracy of any of the tested methods and has moderate execution time.

This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classiﬁcation and automatic object clustering.

For learning such saliency models, we introduce a neural network architecture, which has fully connected layers on top of CNNs responsible for feature extraction at three different scales. The penultimate layer of our neural network has been conﬁrmed to be a discriminative high-level feature vector for saliency detection, which we call deep contrast feature. To generate a more robust feature, we integrate handcrafted low-level features with our deep contrast feature. To promote further research and evaluation of visual saliency models, we also construct a new large database of 4447 challenging images and their pixelwise saliency annotations.

We experiment with two ways of correcting the biased probabilities predicted by some learning methods: Platt Scaling and Isotonic Regression. We qualitatively examine what kinds of distortions these calibration methods are suitable for and quantitatively examine how much data they need to be effective.

In this paper, we describe a method to evaluate the ecological status of coralligenous assemblages along Mediterranean French coasts. Several metrics were selected from literature for coralligenous assemblage description and include functional and structural information: percent cover of visible non-vagile species (using photographic quadrats along a transect) and gorgonian demography. Thirty eight ﬁeld stations were sampled for these metrics in PACA (Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur) region in June 2010 and considered for their morphology (bank, rim), geographical orientation and principal current direction (North, East, West, South) and depth (from −30 to −84 m). Metrics found to be linked to human pressures using ANCOVA and multiple correlation matrix were selected to be included in the index. The index (Coralligenous Assemblage Index, CAI) that we proposed was based on three selected metrics (Bryozoa percent cover, sludge percent cover, builder species percent cover) and considers depth; it was positively and signiﬁcantly linked to anthropization (related to water quality). The 38 stations studied with theoretically good to bad environmental conditions were classiﬁed in levels of status in accordance with our ﬁeld work knowledge. CAI variation was validated with three stations sampled with 30 other photos. This index could be an effective tool for the assessment of the ecological quality of coralligenous communities. It could be applied in the context of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive as well as in conservation and sustainable management of the marine environment.},

	title = {How transferable are features in deep neural networks?},
	abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the ﬁrst layer they learn features similar to Gabor ﬁlters and color blobs. Such ﬁrst-layer features appear not to be speciﬁc to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to speciﬁc by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus speciﬁcity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difﬁculties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A ﬁnal surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after ﬁne-tuning to the target dataset.},

To reduce overﬁtting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective.

	title = {The effects of sedimentation on rocky coast assemblages},
	volume = {41},
	abstract = {Sedimentation is a widespread and increasing process on most rocky coasts. The literature on its effects is reviewed and support is found for the general conclusion that sedimentation is an important ecological factor for hard bottom organisms. Sediments deeply affect the composition, structure and dynamics of rocky coast assemblages, and increased sediment load as a consequence of anthropogenic activities can be a threat to their diversity and functioning. Sediments that accumulate on rocky substrata are important agents of stress and disturbance. They can cause burial, scour and profound modiﬁcations to the characteristics of the bottom surface, and interact with other important physical and biological processes. The effects of sedimentation are complex, because they involve both direct outcomes on settlement, recruitment, growth or survival of individual species and indirect outcomes through mediation of competitive and/or predator–prey interactions. Not all species and assemblages are equally affected by sedimentation and responses vary over space and time, depending on the characteristics of the depositional environment, life histories of species and the stage of development of individuals and assemblages, and in relation to variable physical factors, including hydrodynamics, light intensity and bottom topography. Recent studies have much improved our ability to detect and understand the effects of sedimentation on rocky coast assemblages. However, little is still known about the underlying mechanisms. Overall, our present ability to make generalisations and predictions is limited by a paucity of quantitative and experimental research, and by the scant attention devoted to measuring the regime of perturbation by sediments and responses of organisms at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Predicting the magnitude of the effects that different sedimentation regimes have on rocky coast organisms and the critical levels above which detrimental effects become manifest remains a key issue for the ecology of rocky coasts and a challenge for future studies.},

Whereas the tremendous recent progress in object recognition tasks is due to the availability of large datasets like ImageNet and the rise of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning high-level features, performance at scene recognition has not attained the same level of success. This may be because current deep features trained from ImageNet are not competitive enough for such tasks. Here, we introduce a new scene-centric database called Places with over 7 million labeled pictures of scenes. We propose new methods to compare the density and diversity of image datasets and show that Places is as dense as other scene datasets and has more diversity. Using CNN, we learn deep features for scene recognition tasks, and establish new state-of-the-art results on several scene-centric datasets. A visualization of the CNN layers’ responses allows us to show differences in the internal representations of object-centric and scene-centric networks.},

	abstract = {Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efﬁciency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layerdeep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR, SVHN, COCO, and signiﬁcant improvements on ImageNet.

	abstract = {A technical challenge of deep learning is recognizing target classes without seen data. Zero-shot learning leverages semantic representations such as attributes or class prototypes to bridge source and target classes. Existing standard zero-shot learning methods may be prone to overﬁtting the seen data of source classes as they are blind to the semantic representations of target classes. In this paper, we study generalized zero-shot learning that assumes accessible to target classes for unseen data during training, and prediction on unseen data is made by searching on both source and target classes. We propose a novel Deep Calibration Network (DCN) approach towards this generalized zero-shot learning paradigm, which enables simultaneous calibration of deep networks on the conﬁdence of source classes and uncertainty of target classes. Our approach maps visual features of images and semantic representations of class prototypes to a common embedding space such that the compatibility of seen data to both source and target classes are maximized. We show superior accuracy of our approach over the state of the art on benchmark datasets for generalized zero-shot learning, including AwA, CUB, SUN, and aPY.},

Our results demonstrate an overall tendency towards decline of the areal extent, cover and shoot density of P. oceanica meadows during the last 50 years, the period with the largest availability of records. Available estimates indicated that between 13\% and 50\% of seagrass areal extent of P. oceanica in the Mediterranean basin appear to be lost, and that the remaining meadows of the Mediterranean may have thinned shoot density by 50\% for the last 20 years and have became more fragmented. Considering the changes quantiﬁed in P. oceanica areal extent, cover and density, about 6.9\% of the potential P. oceanica vegetation would have been lost annually over the last 50 years. The loss of P. oceanica meadows in the Mediterranean may have lead to a substantial (between 11\% and 52\%) reduction of the capacity of this key coastal ecosystem to sequester carbon in the last 50 years, hence reducing the carbon sink capacity of the entire Mediterranean Sea. The major causes of P. oceanica loss were widespread local disturbances, but recently, global disturbances, such as climate change and the spread of invasive exotic species, were also seriously threatening Posidonia meadows in the Mediterranean. These ﬁndings urgently call for implementation of management measures aiming at mitigating coastal deterioration by combining local and global actions.},

	abstract = {A longstanding question in computer vision concerns the representation of 3D shapes for recognition: should 3D shapes be represented with descriptors operating on their native 3D formats, such as voxel grid or polygon mesh, or can they be effectively represented with view-based descriptors? We address this question in the context of learning to recognize 3D shapes from a collection of their rendered views on 2D images. We ﬁrst present a standard CNN architecture trained to recognize the shapes’ rendered views independently of each other, and show that a 3D shape can be recognized even from a single view at an accuracy far higher than using state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors. Recognition rates further increase when multiple views of the shapes are provided. In addition, we present a novel CNN architecture that combines information from multiple views of a 3D shape into a single and compact shape descriptor offering even better recognition performance. The same architecture can be applied to accurately recognize human hand-drawn sketches of shapes. We conclude that a collection of 2D views can be highly informative for 3D shape recognition and is amenable to emerging CNN architectures and their derivatives.},

This project shows that compelling classiﬁcation performance can be achieved on such categories even without labeled training data. Given image and class embeddings, we learn a compatibility function such that matching embeddings are assigned a higher score than mismatching ones; zero-shot classiﬁcation of an image proceeds by ﬁnding the label yielding the highest joint compatibility score. We use state-of-the-art image features and focus on different supervised attributes and unsupervised output embeddings either derived from hierarchies or learned from unlabeled text corpora. We establish a substantially improved state-of-the-art on the Animals with Attributes and Caltech-UCSD Birds datasets. Most encouragingly, we demonstrate that purely unsupervised output embeddings (learned from Wikipedia and improved with ﬁnegrained text) achieve compelling results, even outperforming the previous supervised state-of-the-art. By combining different output embeddings, we further improve results.},

	abstract = {Digital photography is widely used by coral reef monitoring programs to assess benthic status and trends. In addition to creating a permanent archive, photographic surveys can be rapidly conducted, which is important in environments where bottom-time is frequently limiting. However, substantial effort is required to manually analyze benthic images; which is expensive and leads to lags before data are available. Using previously analyzed imagery from NOAA’s Paciﬁc Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program, we assessed the capacity of a trained and widely used machine-learning image analysis tool – CoralNet coralnet.ucsd.edu – to generate fully-automated benthic cover estimates for the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) and American Samoa. CoralNet was able to generate estimates of site-level coral cover for both regions that were highly comparable to those generated by human analysts (Pearson’s r {\textgreater} 0.97, and with bias of 1\% or less). CoralNet was generally effective at estimating cover of common coral genera (Pearson’s r {\textgreater} 0.92 and with bias of 2\% or less in 6 of 7 cases), but performance was mixed for other groups including algal categories, although generally better for American Samoa than MHI. CoralNet performance was improved by simplifying the classiﬁcation scheme from genus to functional group and by training within habitat types, i.e., separately for coral-rich, pavement, boulder, or “other” habitats. The close match between humangenerated and CoralNet-generated estimates of coral cover pooled to the scale of island and year demonstrates that CoralNet is capable of generating data suitable for assessing spatial and temporal patterns. The imagery we used was gathered from sites randomly located in {\textless}30 m hard-bottom at multiple islands and habitat-types per region, suggesting our results are likely to be widely applicable. As image acquisition is relatively straightforward, the capacity of fully-automated image analysis tools to minimize the need for resource intensive human analysts opens possibilities for enormous increases in the quantity and consistency of coral reef benthic data that could become available to researchers and managers.},

	abstract = {Increasing anthropogenic pressures urge enhanced knowledge and understanding of the current state of marine biodiversity. This baseline information is pivotal to explore present trends, detect future modifications and propose adequate management actions for marine ecosystems. Coralligenous outcrops are a highly diverse and structurally complex deep-water habitat faced with major threats in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite its ecological, aesthetic and economic value, coralligenous biodiversity patterns are still poorly understood. There is currently no single sampling method that has been demonstrated to be sufficiently representative to ensure adequate community assessment and monitoring in this habitat. Therefore, we propose a rapid non-destructive protocol for biodiversity assessment and monitoring of coralligenous outcrops providing good estimates of its structure and species composition, based on photographic sampling and the determination of presence/absence of macrobenthic species. We used an extensive photographic survey, covering several spatial scales (100s of m to 100s of km) within the NW Mediterranean and including 2 different coralligenous assemblages: Paramuricea clavata (PCA) and Corallium rubrum assemblage (CRA). This approach allowed us to determine the minimal sampling area for each assemblage (5000 cm2 for PCA and 2500 cm2 for CRA). In addition, we conclude that 3 replicates provide an optimal sampling effort in order to maximize the species number and to assess the main biodiversity patterns of studied assemblages in variability studies requiring replicates. We contend that the proposed sampling approach provides a valuable tool for management and conservation planning, monitoring and research programs focused on coralligenous outcrops, potentially also applicable in other benthic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Functional diversity is increasingly identiﬁed as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantiﬁes the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantiﬁes how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artiﬁcial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantiﬁcation and for the classiﬁcation of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the inﬂuence of biotic and abiotic ﬁlters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices.},

Topographically complex surfaces may contain more species due to increased habitat diversity or as a result of increased area per se. Fractal geometry can be used to adjust species richness estimates to control for increases in area on complex surfaces. Application of fractal techniques to a survey of rocky shores demonstrated an unambiguous area-independent effect of topography on species richness in the Isle of Man. In contrast, variation in species richness in south-west England reflected surface availability alone. Multivariate tests and variation in limpet abundances also demonstrated regional variation in the area-independent effects of topography. Community composition did not vary with increasing surface complexity in south-west England. These results suggest large-scale gradients in the effects of heterogeneity on community processes or demography.},

Rocky intertidal shores are the classic model system for investigating theoretical and mechanistic models of habitat complexity, because the structural topography is largely biologically independent and stable over time. In the present study, we investigate how static (topographic complexity and heterogeneity) and dynamic (temperature landscape) components of habitat structure influence the abundance and body-size distribution of invertebrates on a rocky shore. Using a novel approach that included high-resolution 3D fractal surface and temperature measurements, we show that topographic complexity, temperature landscape and habitat heterogeneity had largely independent effects on species abundance and body size. Invertebrate abundance was associated with temperature landscape in 7 of 11 species, while variation in body-size was mostly driven by fractal topography in 7 of 10 species. Overall, the body size−abundance relationship was not influenced by habitat structure, indicating that the effects of habitat structure on body size and abundance were largely independent. The results illustrate the value of combining measures of static and dynamic habitat structure to explain and predict biological patterns on rocky shores.},

However, quantifying habitat quality is problematic because it may comprise of abiotic components at different spatial scales and also be influenced by biotic processes. This study investigated the relationship between reef-associated Caribbean fishes and habitat quality at 2 spatial scales: (1) multiple characteristics of Montastraea annularis coral colonies ({\textless}1 m2) and (2) coral density in a 5 × 5 m plot around each microhabitat. Furthermore, the influence on habitat quality of 2 biotic factors (predation pressure and interactions between competitively superior territorial damselfishes and other species) was considered. A total of 102 M. annularis colonies within thirty 25 m2 plots were surveyed on a Belizean forereef. Generalised linear mixed-effect models demonstrated that both damselfishes and other reefassociated species were correlated with colony-scale habitat quality (more abundant on taller, refuge-rich colonies). Adult reef-associated species were also correlated with larger-scale habitat quality, being more abundant on colonies with high densities of other Montastraea colonies within 25 m2 (probably higher quality home ranges). However, the presence of damselfishes was associated with reduced abundances of other reef-associated species on M. annularis colonies, reflecting the importance of both biotic and abiotic controls of habitat quality. On reefs, coral mortality will reduce the density of optimal colonies and potentially increase the proportion occupied by damselfishes. This may lead to smaller populations of inferior competitors as they are increasingly displaced onto sub-optimal microhabitats.},

The mean substrate rugosity and vertical relief of a quadrat were highly correlated. A correlation analysis was made of the substrate variables and several reef fish community parameters (species richness, number of fishes and diversity). Species richness was highly correlated with substrate rugosity. This relationship was tested in two experimental quadrats and the results were generally in accord with those predicted. Stratification of the fish communities by body size revealed that the correlation w{\textasciitilde}th substrate rugosity was scale-dependent. The fish community parameters were poorly correlated with percentage substrate cover by corals (ramose and glomerate) and by sand.

	abstract = {Animal forests promote marine habitats morphological complexity and functioning. The red gorgonian, Paramuricea clavata, is a key structuring species of the Mediterranean coralligenous habitat and an indicator species of climate effects on habitat functioning. P. clavata metrics such as population structure, morphology and biomass inform on the overall health of coralligenous habitats, but the estimation of these metrics is time and cost consuming, and often requires destructive sampling. As a consequence, the implementation of long-term and wide-area monitoring programmes is limited. This study proposes a novel and transferable Structure from Motion (SfM) based method for the estimation of gorgonian population structure (i.e., maximal height, density, abundance), morphometries (i.e., maximal width, fan surface) and biomass (i.e., coenenchymal Dry Weight, Ash Free Dried Weight). The method includes the estimation of a novel metric (3D canopy surface) describing the gorgonian forest as a mosaic of planes generated by ﬁtting multiple 5 cm × 5 cm facets to a SfM generated point cloud. The performance of the method is assessed for two different cameras (GoPro Hero4 and Sony NEX7). Results showed that for highly dense populations (17 colonies/m2), the SfM-method had lower accuracies in estimating the gorgonians density for both cameras (60\% to 89\%) than for medium to low density populations (14 and 7 colonies/m2) (71\% to 100\%). Results for the validation of the method showed that the correlation between ground truth and SfM estimates for maximal height, maximal width and fan surface were between R2 = 0.63 and R2 = 0.9, and R2 = 0.99 for coenenchymal surface estimation. The methodological approach was used to estimate the biomass of the gorgonian population within the study area and across the coralligenous habitat between −25 to −40 m depth in the Portoﬁno Marine Protected Area. For that purpose, the coenenchymal surface of sampled colonies was obtained and used for the calculations. Results showed biomass values of dry weight and ash free dry weight of 220 g and 32 g for the studied area and to 365 kg and 55 Kg for the coralligenous habitat in the Marine Protected Area. This study highlighted the feasibility of the methodology for the quantiﬁcation of P. clavata metrics as well as the potential of the SfM-method to improve current predictions of the status of the coralligenous habitat in the Mediterranean sea and overall management of threatened ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Species Temporal Turnover (STT) is one of the most familiar metrics to assess changes in assemblage composition as a consequence of climate change. However, STT mixes two components in one metric, changes in assemblage composition caused by a process of species loss or gain (i.e. the nestedness component) and changes in assemblage composition caused by a process of species replacement (i.e. the species replacement component). Drawing on previous studies investigating spatial patterns of beta diversity, we propose measures of STT that allow analysing each component (species replacement vs. nestedness), separately. We also present a mapping strategy to simultaneously visualize changes in species richness and assemblage composition. To illustrate our approach, we used the Mediterranean coastal ﬁsh fauna as a case study. Using Bioclimatic Envelope Models (BEMs) we ﬁrst projected the potential future climatic niches of 288 coastal Mediterranean ﬁsh species based on a global warming scenario. We then aggregated geographically the species-level projections to analyse the projected changes in species richness and composition. Our results show that projected changes in assemblage composition are caused by different processes (species replacement vs. nestedness) in several areas of the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, our mapping strategy highlights that the coastal ﬁsh fauna in several regions of the Mediterranean Sea could experience a ‘cul-de-sac’ effect if exposed to climate warming. Overall, the joint exploration of changes in species richness and composition coupled with the distinction between species replacement and nestedness bears important information for understanding the nature of climate change impacts on biodiversity. These methodological advances should help decision-makers in prioritizing action in the areas facing the greatest vulnerability to climate.},

A key approach has been the designation of global biodiversity hotspots – areas of high species richness and endemism – prioritizing regions that are disproportionately valuable.

We argue that prioritizing the preservation of evolutionary diversity is one way to maximize genotypic and functional diversity, providing ecosystems with the greatest number of options for dealing with an uncertain future.},

The aim of the present study was to characterize relationships between predatory fish assemblages, sea urchin abundances and ecosystem function and services. By means of diet analyses and direct observations in the field, we identified key fish species with the potential to control the herbivore Diadema aff. antillarum and hence preserve fishing resources and coastal productivity in sublittoral rocky reefs around the Canary Islands. Differences in the composition and relative importance of predatory assemblages were observed along a gradient of fishing intensities comprising highly fished, lesser fished and marine protected areas. Increased fishing activity was associated with lower fish predator richness and higher urchin density. Most measures of predatory performance (frequency of predation, ingestion time, urchin size selection) differed between predatory fish species, showing that most predators of Diadema aff. antillarum are not functionally similar. This level of functional variation highlights the relevance of predator richness in controlling sea urchin populations. Depletion in species diversity leads to a loss of functional roles and cascading effects that may constrain ecosystem processes.},

The ongoing overexploitation of global ﬁsh resources concerns our societies, not only in terms of decreasing ﬁsh populations important for consumption and recreational activities. Rather, a number of ecosystem services generated by ﬁsh populations are also at risk, with consequences for biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and ultimately human welfare. Examples are provided from marine and freshwater ecosystems, in various parts of the world, and include all life-stages of ﬁsh. Ecosystem services are here deﬁned as fundamental services for maintaining ecosystem functioning and resilience, or demand-derived services based on human values. To secure the generation of ecosystem services from ﬁsh populations, management approaches need to address the fact that ﬁsh are embedded in ecosystems and that substitutions for declining populations and habitat losses, such as ﬁsh stocking and nature reserves, rarely replace losses of all services. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

These changes in components of the Earth’s biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in inﬂuencing ecosystem properties.

	abstract = {Seagrasses, marine flowering plants, have a long evolutionary history but are now challenged with rapid environmental changes as a result of coastal human population pressures. Seagrasses provide key ecological services, including organic carbon production and export, nutrient cycling, sediment stabilization, enhanced biodiversity, and trophic transfers to adjacent habitats in tropical and temperate regions. They also serve as “coastal canaries,” global biological sentinels of increasing anthropogenic influences in coastal ecosystems, with large-scale losses reported worldwide. Multiple stressors, including sediment and nutrient runoff, physical disturbance, invasive species, disease, commercial fishing practices, aquaculture, overgrazing, algal blooms, and global warming, cause seagrass declines at scales of square meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Reported seagrass losses have led to increased awareness of the need for seagrass protection, monitoring, management, and restoration. However, seagrass science, which has rapidly grown, is disconnected from public awareness of seagrasses, which has lagged behind awareness of other coastal ecosystems. There is a critical need for a targeted global conservation effort that includes a reduction of watershed nutrient and sediment inputs to seagrass habitats and a targeted educational program informing regulators and the public of the value of seagrass meadows.},

	abstract = {Human activities, such as shipping, aquaculture, and the opening of the Suez Canal, have led to the introduction of nearly 1000 alien species into the Mediterranean Sea. We investigated how human activities, by providing pathways for the introduction of alien species, may shape the biodiversity patterns in the Mediterranean Sea. Richness of Red Sea species introduced through the Suez Canal (Lessepsian species) is very high along the eastern Mediterranean coastline, reaching a maximum of 129 species per 100 km2, and declines toward the north and west. The distribution of species introduced by shipping is strikingly different, with several hotspot areas occurring throughout the Mediterranean basin. Two main hotspots for aquaculture-introduced species are observed (the Thau and Venice lagoons). Certain taxonomic groups were mostly introduced through speciﬁc pathways—ﬁsh through the Suez Canal, macrophytes by aquaculture, and invertebrates through the Suez Canal and by shipping. Hence, the local taxonomic identity of the alien species was greatly dependent on the dominant maritime activities/interventions and the related pathways of introduction. The composition of alien species differs among Mediterranean ecoregions; such differences are greater for Lessepsian and aquaculture-introduced species. The spatial pattern of native species biodiversity differs from that of alien species: the overall richness of native species declines from the north-western to the south-eastern regions, while the opposite trend is observed for alien species. The biodiversity of the Mediterranean Sea is changing, and further research is needed to better understand how the new biodiversity patterns shaped by human activities will affect the Mediterranean food webs, ecosystem functioning, and the provision of ecosystem services.},

	abstract = {Biotic indices, which reflect the quality of the environment, are widely used in the marine realm. Sometimes, key species or ecosystem engineers are selected for this purpose. This is the case of the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica, widely used as a biological quality element in the context of the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD). The good quality of a water body and the apparent health of a species, whether or not an ecosystem engineer such as P. oceanica, is not always indicative of the good structure and functioning of the whole ecosystem. A key point of the recent Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is the ecosystem-based approach. Here, on the basis of a simplified conceptual model of the P. oceanica ecosystem, we have proposed an ecosystem-based index of the quality of its functioning, compliant with the MSFD requirements. This index (EBQI) is based upon a set of representative functional compartments, the weighting of these compartments and the assessment of the quality of each compartment by comparison of a supposed baseline. The index well discriminated 17 sites in the north-western Mediterranean (French Riviera, Provence, Corsica, Catalonia and Balearic Islands) covering a wide range of human pressure levels. The strong points of the EBQI are that it is easy to implement, non-destructive, relatively robust, according to the selection of the compartments and to their weighting, and associated with confidence indices that indicate possible weakness and biases and therefore the need for further field data acquisition.},

The seagrass Posidonia oceanica, given its ecological indicator characteristics, has been identiﬁed as one of the elements to determine ecological status under the EU Water Framework Directive. The purpose of this study is therefore to develop a biotic index based on P. oceanica (BiPo), focussing on: (i) the necessity of an index that may be applied over the largest geographical extent possible, (ii) the necessity of a tool for a baseline evaluation of P. oceanica status in the Mediterranean, (iii) the compliance with WFD requirements, (iv) the efﬁciency of the method in terms of reliability and cost. The BiPo index is developed on the basis of all P. oceanica monitoring data available in the western Mediterranean and on a standard assessment of anthropogenic pressures. The index metrics are selected and evaluated on the basis of this pressures assessment, and are subsequently integrated for the evaluation of ecological status. The index is then tested on 15 sites around Corsica (France). The results show that the BiPo well reﬂects meadow health status and ecological status. Furthermore it is reliable, standard and cost-effective, and can be applied to a wide array of management and conservation purposes.},

P. oceanica leaf production fluctuated interannually, but it did not exhibit any steady trend toward decline, indicative of nonhuman effects on changesin water quality in theseareas.Conversely, the steadydecline in vertical rhizome growth rate of P. oceanica observed in two sites suggeststhat shoreline erosion there could derive from human activities. In all meadowsexamined, interannual variability in vertical rhizome growth of P. oceanica showed clear oscillating trends, suggesting alternating episodesof sediment erosion and accretion every 7 yr and at least every 25 yr. Mean sealevel and surface water temperaturehave been increasing for the last two decades,but water transparencyhas been declining. However, overall trends only accounted for 24-37\% of the long-term climatic variance. Rainfall interannual changeswere dominated by time scalesof 8 and 28 yr, whereas water transparency,temperature,and sealevel showed dominant time scalesin the oscillations of 4 and 15 yr, 6 and 20 yr, and 11 and 27 yr, respectively. In addition, 33\% of P. oceanica vertical growth variability in the southern Spanish Mediterranean coast derived from variability in rainfall, suggesting a rise of erosive coastal conditions during rainy years. The similarity in the interannual changesof seagrassgrowth over a wide spatial scale (I ,000 km), together with the significant coupling between seagrassgrowth and climate variability, points out climate change,and not widespreaddeterioration derived from anthropogenic pressure,as the main sourceof the observed changesin the Mcditcrrancan littoral zone.},

Unfortunately, little is known on patterns of spatial variation of structural, morphological and dynamic features of Posidonia oceanica, despite their increasing use as indicators of the status and/or trend of meadows. Here, variations in some such features (such as shoot density, leaf biometry, annual rhizome elongation and leaf formation) were examined on a hierarchy of spatial scales, ranging from cm within individual meadows, to meadows separated by 10 km, using independent full-nested analyses of variance. Overall, at least 3 variables showed significant variations in the mean values on each of the scales examined. Patterns of variability differed among individual traits. Most of the total variation, however, was on the smallest spatial scale examined (i.e. among replicates, shoots or quadrats). For some variables, a significant variation was also associated with the largest scale (i.e. among meadows). Collectively, the results indicated that patchiness in density, morphology and growth exists on a very local scale within P. oceanica meadows along the same isobath. This suggests that sampling designs and analyses which incorporate different spatial scales and appropriate replications should at least be considered in the future when planning large-scale and long-term surveys.},

	abstract = {The diversity of life is one of the most striking aspects of our planet; hence knowing how many species inhabit Earth is among the most fundamental questions in science. Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world’s biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts ,8.7 million (61.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which ,2.2 million (60.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86\% of existing species on Earth and 91\% of species in the ocean still await description. Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.},

Here we illustrate the scale of the problems with species names, synonyms, and their classification, and describe how WoRMS publishes online quality assured information on marine species. Within WoRMS, over 100 global, 12 regional and 4 thematic species databases are integrated with a common taxonomy. Over 240 editors from 133 institutions and 31 countries manage the content. To avoid duplication of effort, content is exchanged with 10 external databases. At present WoRMS contains 460,000 taxonomic names (from Kingdom to subspecies), 368,000 species level combinations of which 215,000 are currently accepted marine species names, and 26,000 related but non-marine species. Associated information includes 150,000 literature sources, 20,000 images, and locations of 44,000 specimens. Usage has grown linearly since its launch in 2007, with about 600,000 unique visitors to the website in 2011, and at least 90 organisations from 12 countries using WoRMS for their data management. By providing easy access to expert-validated content, WoRMS improves quality control in the use of species names, with consequent benefits to taxonomy, ecology, conservation and marine biodiversity research and management. The service manages information on species names that would otherwise be overly costly for individuals, and thus minimises errors in the application of nomenclature standards. WoRMS’ content is expanding to include host-parasite relationships, additional literature sources, locations of specimens, images, distribution range, ecological, and biological data. Species are being categorised as introduced (alien, invasive), of conservation importance, and on other attributes. These developments have a multiplier effect on its potential as a resource for biodiversity research and management. As a consequence of WoRMS, we are witnessing improved communication within the scientific community, and anticipate increased taxonomic efficiency and quality control in marine biodiversity research and management.},

Now, in The Origins of Life, Maynard Smith and Szathmary have completely rewritten Transitions to bring their ideas to a wider audience of general readers. Here is a brilliant, state-of-the-art account of how life evolved on earth, focusing primarily on six major transitions--dramatic breakthroughs in the way that information was passed between generations. The authors offer illuminating explorations of the origin of life itself, the arrival of the first cells with nuclei, the first reproduction by sexual means, the appearance of multicellular plants and animals, the emergence of cooperation and of animal societies, and the birth of language.
The Origins of Life represents the thinking of two leading scientists on questions that engage us all--how life began and how it gradually evolved from tiny invisible cells into whales and trees and human beings.},

	abstract = {Seagrasses worldwide are noted for suffering from mechanical damage caused by boat anchoring. This is particularly so in sites highly frequented by boaters (marine protected areas or coastal urbanised areas). In the last decades, different strategies have been put into practice to reduce such impacts on seagrasses (i.e. by anchoring bans or by deploying boat moorings). More recently, in consideration that few marine protected area (MPA) management bodies or local administrations have the resources to enforce their anchorage regulations, the self-regulatory approach based on education and information of boaters has been preferred in several cases. At present, however, very little is known on the correct anchoring practices to ensure the safeguarding of seagrasses. The aim of the present study was to experimentally quantify in the field the damage caused to Posidonia oceanica shoot density by anchoring. A multifactorial experiment was designed to test whether the damage is dependent on (1) different anchor types (Hall, Danforth and Folding grapnel), (2) the use of a chain vs. a rope, (3) the three anchoring stages (anchor fall, dragging/lock-in and weighing), and finally (4) whether the pattern is consistent among different locations of the meadow.},

	abstract = {The oft-repeated claim that Earth’s biota is entering a sixth “mass extinction” depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the “background” rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.},

	abstract = {Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), primarily from human fossil fuel combustion, reduces ocean pH and causes wholesale shifts in seawater carbonate chemistry. The process of ocean acidiﬁcation is well documented in ﬁeld data, and the rate will accelerate over this century unless future CO2 emissions are curbed dramatically. Acidiﬁcation alters seawater chemical speciation and biogeochemical cycles of many elements and compounds. One well-known effect is the lowering of calcium carbonate saturation states, which impacts shell-forming marine organisms from plankton to benthic molluscs, echinoderms, and corals. Many calcifying species exhibit reduced calciﬁcation and growth rates in laboratory experiments under high-CO2 conditions. Ocean acidiﬁcation also causes an increase in carbon ﬁxation rates in some photosynthetic organisms (both calcifying and noncalcifying). The potential for marine organisms to adapt to increasing CO2 and broader implications for ocean ecosystems are not well known; both are high priorities for future research. Although ocean pH has varied in the geological past, paleo-events may be only imperfect analogs to current conditions.},

	abstract = {Temperate Australia is a global hotspot for marine biodiversity and its waters have experienced well-above global average rates of ocean warming. We review the observed impacts of climate change (e.g. warming, ocean acidiﬁcation, changes in storm patterns) on subtidal temperate coasts in Australia and assess how these systems are likely to respond to further change. Observed impacts are region speciﬁc with the greatest number of species responses attributable to climate change reported in south-eastern Australia, where recent ocean warming has been most pronounced. Here, a decline of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and poleward range extension of a key herbivore (sea urchin) and other trophically important reef organisms has occurred. Although, evidence of changes on other coastlines around Australia is limited, we suggest that this is due to a lack of data rather than lack of change. Because of the east–west orientation of the south coast, most of Australia's temperate waters are found within a narrow latitudinal band, where any southward movement of isotherms is likely to affect species across very large areas. Future increases in temperature are likely to result in further range shifts of macroalgae and associated species, with range contractions and local extinctions to be expected for species that have their northern limits along the southern coastline. While there is currently no evidence of changes attributable to non-temperature related climate impacts, potentially due to a lack of long-term observational data, experimental evidence suggests that ocean acidiﬁcation will result in negative effects on calcifying algae and animals. More importantly, recent experiments suggest the combined effects of climate change and non-climate stressors (overharvesting, reduced water quality) will lower the resilience of temperate marine communities to perturbations (e.g. storms, diseases, and introduced species), many of which are also predicted to increase in frequency and/or severity. Thus climate change is likely to, both by itself and in synergy with other stressors, impose change to southern Australian coastal species, including important habitat-forming algae and the associated ecological functioning of temperate coasts. Management of local and regional-scale stresses may increase the resistance of temperate marine communities to climate stressors and as such, provides an attractive tool for building resilience in temperate systems.},

At two sites off Los Angeles, California, species richness of reef ﬁshes fell 15–25\%, and composition shifted from dominance by northern to southern species. Additionally, by 1993, 95\% of the ﬁsh species had declined in abundance by an average of 69\%. Concurrent declines of similar magnitude were observed for several trophic levels of the benthic ecosystem farther north at Santa Cruz Island where populations of surfperches (Pisces: Embiotocidae), the standing stock of their crustacean prey, and the biomass of understory macroalgae all declined by ϳ80\%. Abundances of ﬁshes fell because declining recruitment of age-0 ﬁsh was insufﬁcient to compensate for losses of older age classes. Annual levels of recruitment of age-0 ﬁshes at all reefs examined fell more than one order of magnitude over two decades and was correlated among years with a broad indicator of Bight-wide productivity, the biomass of macrozooplankton in the California Current. Lower productivity of the coastal marine ecosystem, associated with a climate regime shift in 1976–1977, likely caused large, but unforeseen, impacts on population abundances and trophic structure in nearshore benthic communities.},

In several marine regions, including the Mediterranean and Black Sea, legal mandates and agreements to implement ecosystem-based management and spatial plans provide new opportunities to balance uses and protection of marine ecosystems. Analyses of the intensity and distribution of cumulative impacts of human activities directly connected to the ecological goals of these policy efforts are critically needed. Quantification and mapping of the cumulative impact of 22 drivers to 17 marine ecosystems reveals that 20\% of the entire basin and 60–99\% of the territorial waters of EU member states are heavily impacted, with high human impact occurring in all ecoregions and territorial waters. Less than 1\% of these regions are relatively unaffected. This high impact results from multiple drivers, rather than one individual use or stressor, with climatic drivers (increasing temperature and UV, and acidification), demersal fishing, ship traffic, and, in coastal areas, pollution from land accounting for a majority of cumulative impacts. These results show that coordinated management of key areas and activities could significantly improve the condition of these marine ecosystems.},

Here, we collate all available data for experimental and comparative studies of trawling impacts on whole communities of seabed macroinvertebrates on sedimentary habitats and develop widely applicable methods to estimate depletion and recovery rates of biota after trawling. Depletion of biota and trawl penetration into the seabed are highly correlated. Otter trawls caused the least depletion, removing 6\% of biota per pass and penetrating the seabed on average down to 2.4 cm, whereas hydraulic dredges caused the most depletion, removing 41\% of biota and penetrating the seabed on average 16.1 cm. Median recovery times posttrawling (from 50 to 95\% of unimpacted biomass) ranged between 1.9 and 6.4 y. By accounting for the effects of penetration depth, environmental variation, and uncertainty, the models explained much of the variability of depletion and recovery estimates from single studies. Coupled with large-scale, high-resolution maps of trawling frequency and habitat, our estimates of depletion and recovery rates enable the assessment of trawling impacts on unprecedented spatial scales.},

Here we examine changes to stony corals and associated megabenthic assemblages on seamounts off Tasmania (Australia) with different histories of bottom-contact trawling by analysing 64 504 video frames (25 seamounts) and 704 high-resolution images (7 seamounts). Trawling had a dramatic impact on the seamount benthos: (1) bottom cover of the matrix-forming stony coral Solenosmilia variabilis was reduced by 2 orders of magnitude; (2) loss of coral habitat translated into 3-fold declines in richness, diversity and density of other megabenthos; and (3) megabenthos assemblage structures diverged widely between trawled and untrawled seamounts. On seamounts where trawling had been reduced to {\textless} 5\% a decade ago and ceased completely 5 yr ago, there was no clear signal of recovery of the megabenthos; communities remained impoverished comprising fewer species at reduced densities. Differences in community structure in the trawled (as compared to the untrawled) seamounts were attributed to resistant species that survived initial impacts, others protected in natural refugia and early colonisers. Long-term persistence of trawling impacts on deep-water corals is consistent with their biological traits (e.g. slow growth rates, fragility) that make them particularly vulnerable. Because recovery on seamounts will be slow, the benefits from fishery closures may not be immediately recognisable or measureable. Spatial closures are crucial conservation instruments, but will require long-term commitments and expectations of performance whose time frames match the biological tempo in the deep sea.},

Changes in nutrient sources and cycling began in the 1800s, but eutrophication intensified only after the 1950s, coincident with intensified agricultural practices. Specifically, sedimentary N and C content doubled, d13C increased, and concentrations of pigments indicative of total algal biomass (b-carotene, Chlorophyll a), diatoms (fucoxanthin, diatoxanthin), chlorophytes (lutein-zeaxanthin, Chlorophyll b), and cyanobacteria (canthaxanthin) increased significantly after 1950. Enhanced algal abundance was most strongly related to total N influx and secondly to total P influx. In particular, historical change in algae was related to agricultural N influx and only weakly to agricultural P. In recent decades, wastewater N influx has further stimulated algal biomass, particularly diatoms. In contrast, colonial cyanobacteria were more correlated to total P than total N inputs. Variance-partitioning analysis explained 60\% of the changes in algal abundance and community composition since 1880, with diffuse and point nutrients jointly explaining 36\% of the long-term change in algal biomass. Climate variability has become more important as a factor influencing coastal eutrophication in recent decades, explaining 14\% of the variance in the algal data since 1975. Both urban and agricultural sources of nutrients have degraded water quality, illustrating the need for cooperation between stakeholders at regional levels to achieve ‘‘good ecological status’’ in the Baltic coastal environment.},

Management typically focuses on target populations but lacks effective tools to document or restrain overexploitation of marine ecosystems. Here, we present three indices and accompanying thresholds to detect and delineate ecosystem overfishing (EOF): the Fogarty, Friedland, and Ryther indices. These are based on widely available and readily interpreted catch and satellite data that link fisheries landings to primary production using known limits of trophic transfer efficiency. We propose theoretically and empirically based thresholds for each of those indices; with these criteria, several ecosystems are fished sustainably, but nearly 40 to 50\% of tropical and temperate ecosystems exceed even extreme thresholds. Applying these criteria to global fisheries data results in strong evidence for two specific instances of EOF, increases in both pressure on tropical fish and a climate-mediated polar shift. Here, we show that these two patterns represent evidence for global EOF.},

Our assessment built on more than 200 food web models representing marine ecosystems throughout the world covering the period from 1880 to 2007. All models were constructed based on the same approach, and have been previously documented. We spatially and temporally distributed fish biomasses delivered by these models based on fish habitat preferences, ecology, and feeding conditions. From these distributions, we extracted over 68 000 estimates of biomass (for predatory and prey fishes separately, including trophic level of 3.5 or higher, and trophic level between 2.0 and 3.0, respectively), and predicted spatial−temporal trends in fish biomass using multiple regression. Our results predicted that the biomass of predatory fish in the world oceans has declined by twothirds over the last 100 yr. This decline is accelerating, with 54\% occurring in the last 40 yr. Results also showed that the biomass of prey fish has increased over the last 100 yr, likely as a consequence of predation release. These findings allowed us to predict that there will be fish in the future ocean, but the composition of fish assemblages will be very different from current ones, with small prey fish dominating. Our results show that the trophic structure of marine ecosystems has changed at a global scale, in a manner consistent with fishing down marine food webs.},

This implies that harvest rate targets should be lower than has often been assumed, especially when stock size assessments are uncertain. In the end the high cost of information for accurate stock assessment may call for an alternative approach to management, involving regulation of exploitation rate via measures such as large-scale closures (refuges) that directly restrict the proportion of fish available to harvest. Development of predictive models for such regulatory options is a major challenge for fisheries assessment science.},

	abstract = {Forage fish support the largest fisheries in the world but also play key roles in marine food webs by transferring energy from plankton to upper trophic-level predators, such as large fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Fishing can, thereby, have far reaching consequences on marine food webs unless safeguards are in place to avoid depleting forage fish to dangerously low levels, where dependent predators are most vulnerable. However, disentangling the contributions of fishing vs. natural processes on population dynamics has been difficult because of the sensitivity of these stocks to environmental conditions. Here, we overcome this difficulty by collating population time series for forage fish populations that account for nearly two-thirds of global catch of forage fish to identify the fingerprint of fisheries on their population dynamics. Forage fish population collapses shared a set of common and unique characteristics: high fishing pressure for several years before collapse, a sharp drop in natural population productivity, and a lagged response to reduce fishing pressure. Lagged response to natural productivity declines can sharply amplify the magnitude of naturally occurring population fluctuations. Finally, we show that the magnitude and frequency of collapses are greater than expected from natural productivity characteristics and therefore, likely attributed to fishing. The durations of collapses, however, were not different from those expected based on natural productivity shifts. A risk-based management scheme that reduces fishing when populations become scarce would protect forage fish and their predators from collapse with little effect on long-term average catches.},

In response, concerns about risks to marine wildlife upon exposure to the varied forms of plastic debris have increased, stimulating new research into the extent and consequences of plastics contamination in the marine environment. Here, I present a framework to evaluate the current understanding of the sources, distribution, fate, and impacts of marine plastics. Despite remaining knowledge gaps in mass budgeting and challenges in investigating ecological impacts, the increasing evidence of the ubiquity of plastics contamination in the marine environment, the continued rapid growth in plastics production, and the evidence—albeit limited—of demonstrated impacts to marine wildlife support immediate implementation of source-reducing measures to decrease the potential risks of plastics in the marine ecosystem.},

Although a large number of empirical studies provide emerging evidence of impacts to wildlife, there has been little systematic assessment of risk. We performed a spatial risk analysis using predicted debris distributions and ranges for 186 seabird species to model debris exposure. We adjusted the model using published data on plastic ingestion by seabirds. Eighty of 135 (59\%) species with studies reported in the literature between 1962 and 2012 had ingested plastic, and, within those studies, on average 29\% of individuals had plastic in their gut. Standardizing the data for time and species, we estimate the ingestion rate would reach 90\% of individuals if these studies were conducted today. Using these results from the literature, we tuned our risk model and were able to capture 71\% of the variation in plastic ingestion based on a model including exposure, time, study method, and body size. We used this tuned model to predict risk across seabird species at the global scale. The highest area of expected impact occurs at the Southern Ocean boundary in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand, which contrasts with previous work identifying this area as having low anthropogenic pressures and concentrations of marine debris. We predict that plastics ingestion is increasing in seabirds, that it will reach 99\% of all species by 2050, and that effective waste management can reduce this threat.},

	abstract = {As a result of increased nutrient levels in the Baltic Sea during the past 50 years, mass developments of ﬁlamentous algae have become a common feature along the Swedish east coast and deposition of organic matter has also increased. To test whether these two factors have any effects on the early life stages of Fucus vesiculosus a number of laboratory and ﬁeld studies were conducted. The amount of epilithic and epiphytic ﬁlamentous algae on F. vesiculosus and the amount of deposited matter in the littoral zone were quantiﬁed during the two reproductive periods of F. vesiculosus, early summer (May–June) and late autumn (September–October). Both ﬁlamentous algae (Cladophora glomerata) and deposited matter (introduced either before or after settlement of fertilized eggs) were shown to signiﬁcantly decrease the number of surviving germlings. The survival of germlings seeded on stones with ﬁlamentous algae, or seeded on culture dishes concurrently with the lowest concentration of deposited matter (0.1 g dm−2), was 5\% or less. In the ﬁeld, the amount of ﬁlamentous algae was signiﬁcantly higher during F. vesiculosus summer reproduction, whereas the amount of deposited matter collected in traps was signiﬁcantly higher during the period of autumn reproduction. The greatest biomass of ﬁlamentous algae was observed at sheltered sites. Based on the negative effects of ﬁlamentous algae and deposited matter on Fucus recruitment and the observation of local and seasonal differences in abundance of ﬁlamentous algae and deposition, we suggest that the prerequisites for the survival of either summer or autumn-reproducing populations of F. vesiculosus in the Baltic Sea may differ locally.},

Although researchers have reported on ingestion of anthropogenic debris by marine turtles and implied incidences of debris ingestion have increased over time, there has not been a global synthesis of the phenomenon since 1985. Thus, we analyzed 37 studies published from 1985 to 2012 that report on data collected from before 1900 through 2011. Specifically, we investigated whether ingestion prevalence has changed over time, what types of debris are most commonly ingested, the geographic distribution of debris ingestion by marine turtles relative to global debris distribution, and which species and life-history stages are most likely to ingest debris. The probability of green (Chelonia mydas) and leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) ingesting debris increased significantly over time, and plastic was the most commonly ingested debris. Turtles in nearly all regions studied ingest debris, but the probability of ingestion was not related to modeled debris densities. Furthermore, smaller, oceanic-stage turtles were more likely to ingest debris than coastal foragers, whereas carnivorous species were less likely to ingest debris than herbivores or gelatinovores. Our results indicate oceanic leatherback turtles and green turtles are at the greatest risk of both lethal and sublethal effects from ingested marine debris. To reduce this risk, anthropogenic debris must be managed at a global level.},

	abstract = {Globally, 6.4 million tons of fishing gear are lost in the oceans annually. This gear (i.e., ghost nets), whether accidently lost, abandoned, or deliberately discarded, threatens marine wildlife as it drifts with prevailing currents and continues to entangle marine organisms indiscriminately. Northern Australia has some of the highest densities of ghost nets in the world, with up to 3 tons washing ashore per kilometer of shoreline annually. This region supports globally significant populations of internationally threatened marine fauna, including 6 of the 7 extant marine turtles. We examined the threat ghost nets pose to marine turtles and assessed whether nets associated with particular fisheries are linked with turtle entanglement by analyzing the capture rates of turtles and potential source fisheries from nearly 9000 nets found on Australia’s northern coast. Nets with relatively larger mesh and smaller twine sizes (e.g., pelagic drift nets) had the highest probability of entanglement for marine turtles. Net size was important; larger nets appeared to attract turtles, which further increased their catch rates. Our results point to issues with trawl and drift-net fisheries, the former due to the large number of nets and fragments found and the latter due to the very high catch rates resulting from the net design. Catch rates for fine-mesh gill nets can reach as high as 4 turtles/100 m of net length. We estimated that the total number of turtles caught by the 8690 ghost nets we sampled was between 4866 and 14,600, assuming nets drift for 1 year. Ghost nets continue to accumulate on Australia’s northern shore due to both legal and illegal fishing; over 13,000 nets have been removed since 2005. This is an important and ongoing transboundary threat to biodiversity in the region that requires attention from the countries surrounding the Arafura and Timor Seas.},

	abstract = {Countless submerged rocky formations are scattered in the marine coastal area of the Veneto region (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy). They are known to be suitable substrates for supporting the development of highly complex ﬁsh and zoobenthic communities. However, these areas are threatened by local ﬁshing, due to their peculiar morphology and topography which promote gear entanglement. With the aims of quantifying the impacts of abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded ﬁshing gear (ALDFG) on these rocky habitats and monitoring the biodiversity recovery after ALDFG removal, acoustic and diving surveys were performed to map 15 selected rocky outcrops and one artiﬁcial reef (for a total surface area of 21 km2). The recovery capability of benthic and ﬁsh communities was evaluated by non-destructive techniques in 5 outcrops periodically sampled throughout 18 months. The data collected (number of individuals, species, taxa, and coverage per each species and taxon) were used to calculate three biodiversity indices (species richness, Margalef and Shannon indices) and to assess community recovery. Mapping activities veriﬁed the occurrence of 347 ALDFG distributed unevenly over half of the investigated rocky outcrops. The following cleaning operations led to the removal of 362 items, for a total dry weight of 514 kg. The study on biodiversity recovery showed that the complexity of benthic communities gradually improved. In particular, the various biodiversity indices evaluated at the end of the monitoring period generally showed values comparable, or even higher, than those recorded in the reference sites. An increase in biodiversity and species abundance was also observed for ﬁsh community; in particular, cryptic species were able to occupy cracks and fractures of rocks previously obstructed by the derelict ﬁshing gear.},

	abstract = {The incidence of marine trafﬁc has risen in recent decades and is expected to continue rising as maritime trafﬁc, vessel speed, and engine power all continue to increase. Although long considered anecdotal, ship strikes are now recognized as a major threat to cetaceans. However, estimation of ship strike rates is still challenging notably because such events occurred generally far offshore and collision between large ships and whales go often unnoticed by ship crew. The monitoring of marine mammal strandings remain one the most efﬁcient ways to evaluate the problem. In France, a national coordinated network collected data and samples on stranded marine mammals since 1972 along the Mediterranean and Atlantic French coasts. We examined stranding data, including photography and necropsy reports, collected between 1972 and 2017 with the aim to provide a comprehensive review of conﬁrmed collision records of large whales in France. During this period, a total of 51 ship strike incidents were identiﬁed which represents the 1st identiﬁed causes of mortality for large whale in France. It has increased since 1972 with seven records during the 1st decade to reach 22 stranded animals observed between 2005 and 2017. This issue appears particularly critical in the Mediterranean Sea where one in ﬁve stranded whales showed evidence of ship strike. This review of collision records highlights the risk of a negative impact of this anthropogenic pressure on the dynamic of whale populations in Europe, suggesting that ship strike rates could not allow achieving the Good Environmental Status of marine mammal populations required by the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

This study is the first to investigate the effect of marine traffic on the behaviour of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus in the Istanbul Strait, Turkey. The Istanbul Strait (also known as the Bosphorus) is one of the busiest international waterways in the world and is exposed to dense marine traffic. The effect of marine traffic, location and season on the behavioural transitions was investigated through general log-linear analysis. Further, the changes on the behavioural budget and bout duration were assessed using Markov chains. Results showed that marine vessels were the main driving force for the behavioural transitions. These changes in transitions between behaviours led to significant changes in behavioural budget and bout durations (average time in each behavioural state). Surface-feeding, resting and socialising behaviour significantly decreased in the control budget, while diving showed an increase in the presence of vessels. Moreover, dolphins spent less time surface-feeding, resting, socialising and diving once disrupted. Furthermore, the current level of vessel−dolphin interaction (51\%) in the Istanbul Strait was sufficiently high to alter the dolphins’ cumulative behavioural budget significantly. Finally, speed and distance of vessels played a considerable role in the directional responses of dolphins. These results raise concerns on the potential biological consequences of the observed behavioural changes, considering that the population is already classified ‘at risk’ and is still lacking species-specific conservation plans. The results of the study must be considered immediately to create protected zones in order to mitigate the vessel−dolphin interactions.},

Aquaculture farms are thought to repel some species and function as either attractive population sinks (‘ecological traps’) or population sources for others. We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of empirical studies documenting interactions between aquaculture operations and vertebrate wildlife. Farms were associated with elevated local abundance and diversity of wildlife, although this overall effect was strongly driven by aggregations of wild ﬁsh at sea cages and shellﬁsh farms (abundance: 729; species richness: 2.09). Birds were also more diverse at farms (1.19), but other taxa showed variable and comparatively small effects. Larger effects were reported when researchers selected featureless or unstructured habitats as reference sites. Evidence for aggregation ‘hotspots’ is clear in some systems, but we cannot determine whether farms act as ecological traps for most taxa, as few studies assess either habitat preference or ﬁtness in wildlife. Fish collected near farms were larger and heavier with no change in body condition, but also faced higher risk of disease and parasitism. Birds and mammals were frequently reported preying on stock, but little data exist on the outcomes of such interactions for birds and mammals – farms are likely to function as ecological traps for many species. We recommend researchers measure survival and reproduction in farm-associated wildlife to make direct, causal links between aquaculture and its effects on wildlife populations.},

	abstract = {Background: Two decades of research showing that increasing plant diversity results in greater community productivity has been predicated on greater functional diversity allowing access to more of the total available resources. Thus, understanding phenotypic attributes that allow species to partition resources is fundamentally important to explaining diversity-productivity relationships.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we use data from a long-term experiment (Cedar Creek, MN) and compare the extent to which productivity is explained by seven types of community metrics of functional variation: 1) species richness, 2) variation in 10 individual traits, 3) functional group richness, 4) a distance-based measure of functional diversity, 5) a hierarchical multivariate clustering method, 6) a nonmetric multidimensional scaling approach, and 7) a phylogenetic diversity measure, summing phylogenetic branch lengths connecting community members together and may be a surrogate for ecological differences. Although most of these diversity measures provided significant explanations of variation in productivity, the presence of a nitrogen fixer and phylogenetic diversity were the two best explanatory variables. Further, a statistical model that included the presence of a nitrogen fixer, seed weight and phylogenetic diversity was a better explanation of community productivity than other models.
Conclusions: Evolutionary relationships among species appear to explain patterns of grassland productivity. Further, these results reveal that functional differences among species involve a complex suite of traits and that perhaps phylogenetic relationships provide a better measure of the diversity among species that contributes to productivity than individual or small groups of traits.},

Here, we propose a means for quantifying functional diversity that may be particularly useful for determining how functional diversity is related to ecosystem functioning. This measure of functional diversity ‘‘FD’’ is deﬁned as the total branch length of a functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species’ trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

	volume = {92},
	doi = {10.1016/j.ecss.2011.02.007},
	abstract = {This review examines the various strategies and methods used to produce benthic habitat maps using
acoustic remote sensing techniques, coupled with in situ sampling. The applications of three acoustic survey
techniques are examined in detail: single-beam acoustic ground discrimination systems, sidescan sonar
systems, and multi-beam echo sounders. Over the past decade we have witnessed the nascence of the field
of benthic habitat mapping and, on the evidence of the literature reviewed in this paper, have seen a rapid
evolution in the level of sophistication in our ability to image and thus map seafloor habitats. As acoustic
survey tools have become ever more complex, new methods have been tested to segment, classify and
combine these data with biological ground truth sample data. Although the specific methods used to derive
habitat maps vary considerably, the review indicates that studies can generally be categorized into one of
three over-arching strategies; 1) Abiotic surrogate mapping; 2) Assemble first, predict later (unsupervised
classification); 3) Predict first, assemble later (supervised classification). Whilst there is still no widely
accepted agreement on the bestway to produce benthic habitat maps, all three strategies provide valuable
map resources to support management objectives. Whilst there is still considerable work to be done before
we can answer many of the outstanding technological, methodological, ecological and theoretical questions
that have been raised here, the reviewconcludes that the advent of spatial ecological studies founded
on high-resolution environmental data sets will undoubtedly help us to examine patterns in community
and species distributions. This is a vital first step in unraveling ecological complexities and thus providing
improved spatial information for management of marine systems.},

for an autonomous mobile robot operating in unknown and unstructured
environments is described. The system uses sonar range data to build a
multileveled description of the robot’s surroundings. Sonar readings are
interpreted using probability profiles to determine empty and occupied
areas. Range measurements from multiple points of view are integrated
into a sensor-level sonar map, using a robust method that combines the
sensor information in such a way as to cope with uncertainties and errors
in the data. The resulting two-dimensional maps are used for path
planning and navigation. From these sonar maps, multiple representations
are developed for various kinds of problem-solving activities.
Several dimensions of representation are defined: the abstraction axis, the
geographical axis, and the resolution axis. The sonar mapping procedures
have been implemented as part of an autonomous mobile robot
navigation system called Dolphin. The major modules of this system are
described and related to the various mapping representations used.
Results from actual runs are presented, and further research is mentioned.
The system is also situated within the widerc ontext of developing

Moreover, instead of cold and dry gas found in open-circuit systems the diver takes advantage of a warm and humid breathing gas. Stealth (through silent, bubble-free diving) can be beneficial for scientists exploring a range of natural ecological research areas. The high gas efficiency of rebreathers, combined with their lower operational costs, can provide longer autonomy and shortened decompression obligations that may assist the scientist with deeper diving explorations. The present paper gives an overview of today’s rebreather technology and focuses especially on the needs of scientific divers. Moreover, it includes a short report about achievements in the field of deep coral explorations, where advanced electronically-controlled closed-loop rebreather systems were the key for efficient and successful missions.},

The present paper gives an overview of some of the applications of remote sensing in the field of satellite oceanography. From the present review, it can be conclude that, even though IR and microwave radiometers can be used for measuring temperatures at different depths in oceans, better choice is to use microwave data as it has got the advantage of penetrating through clouds and also it gives a clear view in all weather conditions except rain. Band ratio approach can be used for identifying different water quality parameters. In recent past, satellite remote sensing has become an ideal tool for identifying Potential fishing zone (PFZ).},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are in decline worldwide and monitoring activities are important for assessing the impact of disturbance on reefs and tracking subsequent recovery or decline. Monitoring by ﬁeld surveys provides accurate data but at highly localised scales and so is not cost-effective for reef scale monitoring at frequent time points. Remote sensing from satellites is an alternative and complementary approach. While remote sensing cannot provide the level of detail and accuracy at a single point than a ﬁeld survey, the statistical power for inferring large scale patterns beneﬁts in having complete areal coverage. This review considers the state of the art of coral reef remote sensing for the diverse range of objectives relevant for management, ranging from the composition of the reef: physical extent, benthic cover, bathymetry, rugosity; to environmental parameters: sea surface temperature, exposure, light, carbonate chemistry. In addition to updating previous reviews, here we also consider the capability to go beyond basic maps of habitats or environmental variables, to discuss concepts highly relevant to stakeholders, policy makers and public communication: such as biodiversity, environmental threat and ecosystem services. A clear conclusion of the review is that advances in both sensor technology and processing algorithms continue to drive forward remote sensing capability for coral reef mapping, particularly with respect to spatial resolution of maps, and synthesis across multiple data products. Both trends can be expected to continue.},

Remote Sensing (RS) is a useful tool allowing for mapping seagrass meadows and other important marine habitats. In this study, we explore the global scientific literature on RS applied to both P. oceanica and MPAs tracking its evolution and trends by applying network analysis to bibliometric science. The software VOSviewer was used to create maps based on network data of scientific publications displaying relationships among authors and countries. In addition, specific keywords were used to explore the co-occurrence of different terms characterizing the application of RS in marine science. Results showed that France is the main country publishing on RS applied to Posidonia oceanica while Pergent Gérard and Pergent-Martini Cristine resulted the top authors. The co-occurrences analysis highlighted that RS is primarily used for seagrasses mapping, while few studies are focused on their monitoring. Furthermore, investigating RS in connection with MPAs the main country resulted Australia while the top author was Andréfouet. The network map of keywords showed that RS is widely applied to MPAs to study coral reefs and their biodiversity and for mapping marine ecosystems. The use of RS for monitoring Posidonia oceanica beds and MPAs resulted a poorly explored research area, probably due to the low resolution of available data determining large scale habitat mapping. In conclusion, we maintain that RS applications can provide useful information about the effects of local human activities and global climate change on marine ecosystems.},

As favored by modern corals, reef-forming organisms have typically adopted a niche in warm, shallow, well-lit, tropical marine waters, where they are capable of building vast carbonate ediﬁces. Because fossil reefs form water aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs, considerable effort has been dedicated to understanding their anatomy and morphology. Remote sensing has a particular role to play here. Interpretation of satellite images has done much to reveal the grand spatial and temporal tapestry of tropical reefs. Comparative sedimentology, whereby modern environments are contrasted with the rock record to improve interpretation, has been particularly transformed by observations made from orbit. Satellite mapping has also become a keystone technology to quantify the coral reef crisis—it can be deployed not only directly to quantify the distribution of coral communities, but also indirectly to establish a climatology for their physical environment. This article reviews the application of remote sensing to tropical coralgal reefs in order to communicate how this fast-growing technology might be central to addressing the coral reef crisis and to look ahead at future developments in the science.},

Synoptic capabilities of remote sensing techniques allow assessments that are impossible to do with traditional methods.

To measure the indices we experiment the use of DNNs on two different computer architectures, a workstation equipped with a NVIDIA Titan X Pascal and an embedded system based on a NVIDIA Jetson TX1 board. This experimentation allows a direct comparison between DNNs running on machines with very different computational capacity. This study is useful for researchers to have a complete view of what solutions have been explored so far and in which research directions are worth exploring in the future; and for practitioners to select the DNN architecture(s) that better ﬁt the resource constraints of practical deployments and applications. To complete this work, all the DNNs, as well as the software used for the analysis, are available online.},

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3 × 3) convolution ﬁlters, which shows that a signiﬁcant improvement on the prior-art conﬁgurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16–19 weight layers. These ﬁndings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the ﬁrst and the second places in the localisation and classiﬁcation tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a signiﬁcant margin. Using an ensemble of batchnormalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classiﬁcation: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

Large networks are alsoslow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of manydifferent large neural nets at test time.  Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem.The  key  idea  is  to  randomly  drop  units  (along  with  their  connections)  from  the  neuralnetwork during training.  This prevents units from co-adapting too much.  During training,dropout samples from an exponential number of different “thinned” networks.  At test time,it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networksby simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights.  This significantlyreduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods.

First, by viewing BN as an implicit regularizer, BN can be decomposed into population normalization (PN) and gamma decay as an explicit regularization. Second, learning dynamics of BN and the regularization show that training converged with large maximum and effective learning rate. Third, generalization of BN is explored by using statistical mechanics. Experiments demonstrate that BN in convolutional neural networks share the same traits of regularization as the above analyses.},

With the growing number of available architectures, picking one over another is far from obvious. Existing art suggests that, when performing transfer learning, the performance of CNN architectures on ImageNet correlates strongly with their performance on target tasks. We evaluate that claim for melanoma classiﬁcation, over 9 CNNs architectures, in 5 sets of splits created on the ISIC Challenge 2017 dataset, and 3 repeated measures, resulting in 135 models. The correlations we found were, to begin with, much smaller than those reported by existing art, and disappeared altogether when we considered only the top-performing networks: uncontrolled nuisances (i.e., splits and randomness) overcome any of the analyzed factors. Whenever possible, the best approach for melanoma classiﬁcation is still to create ensembles of multiple models. We compared two choices for selecting which models to ensemble: picking them at random (among a pool of highquality ones) vs. using the validation set to determine which ones to pick ﬁrst. For small ensembles, we found a slight advantage on the second approach but found that random choice was also competitive. Although our aim in this paper was not to maximize performance, we easily reached AUCs comparable to the ﬁrst place on the ISIC Challenge 2017.},

While the use of large mini-batches increases the avail-able computational parallelism, small batch training has been shown to provideimproved generalization performance and allows a significantly smaller memoryfootprint, which might also be exploited to improve machine throughput.In this paper, we review common assumptions on learning rate scaling and train-ing duration, as a basis for an experimental comparison of test performance fordifferent mini-batch sizes. We adopt a learning rate that corresponds to a constantaverage weight update per gradient calculation (i.e., per unit cost of computation),and point out that this results in a variance of the weight updates that increaseslinearly with the mini-batch sizem.The collected experimental results for the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNetdatasets show that increasing the mini-batch size progressively reduces the rangeof learning rates that provide stable convergence and acceptable test performance.On the other hand, small mini-batch sizes provide more up-to-date gradient cal-culations, which yields more stable and reliable training.  The best performancehas been consistently obtained for mini-batch sizes between m= 2 and m= 32, which contrasts with recent work advocating the use of mini-batch sizes in thethousands.},

This work provides an empirical investigation into the various facets of this question, such as, looking at the importance of the amount of examples, number of classes, balance between images-per-class and classes, and the role of ﬁne and coarse grained recognition. We pre-train CNN features on various subsets of the ImageNet dataset and evaluate transfer performance on a variety of standard vision tasks. Our overall ﬁndings suggest that most changes in the choice of pre-training data long thought to be critical, do not signiﬁcantly affect transfer performance.},

The objective of this sub-challenge is to classify the emotions expressed by the primary human subject in static images extracted from movies. We follow a transfer learning approach for deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. Starting from a network pre-trained on the generic ImageNet dataset, we perform supervised ﬁne-tuning on the network in a two-stage process, ﬁrst on datasets relevant to facial expressions, followed by the contest’s dataset. Experimental results show that this cascading ﬁne-tuning approach achieves better results, compared to a single stage ﬁnetuning with the combined datasets. Our best submission exhibited an overall accuracy of 48.5\% in the validation set and 55.6\% in the test set, which compares favorably to the respective 35.96\% and 39.13\% of the challenge baseline.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04340},
	abstract = {Effective training of neural networks requires much data. In the low-data regime, parameters are underdetermined, and learnt networks generalise poorly. Data Augmentation (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) alleviates this by using existing data more effectively. However standard data augmentation produces only limited plausible alternative data. Given there is potential to generate a much broader set of augmentations, we design and train a generative model to do data augmentation. The model, based on image conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, takes data from a source domain and learns to take any data item and generalise it to generate other within-class data items. As this generative process does not depend on the classes themselves, it can be applied to novel unseen classes of data. We show that a Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Network (DAGAN) augments standard vanilla classiﬁers well. We also show a DAGAN can enhance few-shot learning systems such as Matching Networks. We demonstrate these approaches on Omniglot, on EMNIST having learnt the DAGAN on Omniglot, and VGG-Face data. In our experiments we can see over 13\% increase in accuracy in the low-data regime experiments in Omniglot (from 69\% to 82\%), EMNIST (73.9\% to 76\%) and VGG-Face (4.5\% to 12\%); in Matching Networks for Omniglot we observe an increase of 0.5\% (from 96.9\% to 97.4\%) and an increase of 1.8\% in EMNIST (from 59.5\% to 61.3\%).},

The exact criterion used for validation-based early stopping, however, is usually chosen in an ad-hoc fashion or training is stopped interactively. This trick describes how to select a stopping criterion in a systematic fashion; it is a trick for either speeding learning procedures or improving generalization, whichever is more important in the particular situation. An empirical investigation on multi-layer perceptrons shows that there exists a tradeoﬀ between training time and generalization: From the given mix of 1296 training runs using diﬀerent 12 problems and 24 diﬀerent network architectures I conclude slower stopping criteria allow for small improvements in generalization (here: about 4\% on average), but cost much more training time (here: about factor 4 longer on average).},

	abstract = {Gradient descent training of neural networks can be done in either a batch or on-line manner. A widely held myth in the neural network community is that batch training is as fast or faster and/or more ‘correct’ than on-line training because it supposedly uses a better approximation of the true gradient for its weight updates. This paper explains why batch training is almost always slower than on-line training—often orders of magnitude slower—especially on large training sets. The main reason is due to the ability of on-line training to follow curves in the error surface throughout each epoch, which allows it to safely use a larger learning rate and thus converge with less iterations through the training data. Empirical results on a large (20,000-instance) speech recognition task and on 26 other learning tasks demonstrate that convergence can be reached signiﬁcantly faster using on-line training than batch training, with no apparent difference in accuracy.},

	abstract = {Marine mammals (whales, dolphins, seals, sea lions, sea cows) use sound both actively and passively to communicate and sense their environment, covering frequencies from a few hertz to greater than 100 kHz, differing with species. Although a few documents on marine mammal sound production and reception date back 200 years, concern about the effects of man-made noise on marine mammals has only been documented since the 1970s. Underwater noise can interfere with key life functions of marine mammals (e.g., foraging, mating, nursing, resting, migrating) by impairing hearing sensitivity, masking acoustic signals, eliciting behavioral responses, or causing physiological stress. Many countries are developing and updating guidelines and regulations for underwater noise management in relation to marine mammal conservation. In the United States, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, enacted in 1972, is increasingly being applied to underwater noise emission. Common mitigation methods include (1) time/area closures, (2) the establishment of safety zones that are monitored by visual observers or passive acoustics and that lead to shut-down or low-power operations if animals enter these zones, (3) noise reduction gear like bubble curtains around pile driving, and (4) noise source modifications or operational parameters like soft starts. Mitigation management mostly deals with single operations (like a one-month seismic survey). Key questions that remain are how noise impacts accumulate over time and multiple exposures, how multiple acoustic and nonacoustic stressors interact, and how effects on individuals affect a population as a whole.},

	abstract = {Much biodiversity data is collected worldwide, but it remains challenging to assemble the scattered knowledge for assessing biodiversity status and trends. The concept of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) was introduced to structure biodiversity monitoring globally, and to harmonize and standardize biodiversity data from disparate sources to capture a minimum set of critical variables required to study, report and manage biodiversity change. Here, we assess the challenges of a ‘Big Data’ approach to building global EBV data products across taxa and spatiotemporal scales, focusing on species distribution and abundance. The majority of currently available data on species distributions derives from incidentally reported observations or from surveys where presence-only or presence–absence data are sampled repeatedly with standardized protocols. Most abundance data come from opportunistic population counts or from population time series using standardized protocols (e.g. repeated surveys of the same population from single or multiple sites). Enormous complexity exists in integrating these heterogeneous, multi-source data sets across space, time, taxa and different sampling methods. Integration of such data into global EBV data products requires correcting biases introduced by imperfect detection and varying sampling effort, dealing with different spatial resolution and extents, harmonizing measurement units from different data sources or sampling methods, applying statistical tools and models for spatial inter- or extrapolation, and quantifying sources of uncertainty and errors in data and models. To support the development of EBVs by the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON), we identify 11 key workﬂow steps that will operationalize the process of building EBV data products within and across research infrastructures worldwide. These workﬂow steps take multiple sequential activities into account, including identiﬁcation and aggregation of various raw data sources, data quality control, taxonomic name matching and statistical modelling of integrated data. We illustrate these steps with concrete examples from existing citizen science and professional monitoring projects, including eBird, the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring network, the Living Planet Index and the Baltic Sea zooplankton monitoring. The identiﬁed workﬂow steps are applicable to both terrestrial and aquatic systems and a broad range of spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales. They depend on clear, ﬁndable and accessible metadata, and we provide an overview of current data and metadata standards. Several challenges remain to be solved for building global EBV data products: (i) developing tools and models for combining heterogeneous, multi-source data sets and ﬁlling data gaps in geographic, temporal and taxonomic coverage, (ii) integrating emerging methods and technologies for data collection such as citizen science, sensor networks, DNA-based techniques and satellite remote sensing, (iii) solving major technical issues related to data product structure, data storage, execution of workﬂows and the production process/cycle as well as approaching technical interoperability among research infrastructures, (iv) allowing semantic interoperability by developing and adopting standards and tools for capturing consistent data and metadata, and (v) ensuring legal interoperability by endorsing open data or data that are free from restrictions on use, modiﬁcation and sharing. Addressing these challenges is critical for biodiversity research and for assessing progress towards conservation policy targets and sustainable development goals.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is, next to water vapour, considered to be the most important natural greenhouse gas on Earth. Rapidly rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused by human actions such as fossil fuel burning, land-use change or cement production over the past 250 years have given cause for concern that changes in Earth’s climate system may progress at a much faster pace and larger extent than during the past 20 000 years. Investigating global carbon cycle pathways and ﬁnding suitable adaptation and mitigation strategies has, therefore, become of major concern in many research ﬁelds. The oceans have a key role in regulating atmospheric CO2 concentrations and currently take up about 25 \% of annual anthropogenic carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Questions that yet need to be answered are what the carbon uptake kinetics of the oceans will be in the future and how the increase in oceanic carbon inventory will affect its ecosystems and their services. This requires comprehensive investigations, including high-quality ocean carbon measurements on different spatial and temporal scales, the management of data in sophisticated databases, the application of Earth system models to provide future projections for given emission scenarios as well as a global synthesis and outreach to policy makers. In this paper, the current understanding of the ocean as an important carbon sink is reviewed with respect to these topics. Emphasis is placed on the complex interplay of different physical, chemical and biological processes that yield both positive and negative air–sea ﬂux values for natural and anthropogenic CO2 as well as on increased CO2 (uptake) as the regulating force of the radiative warming of the atmosphere and the gradual acidiﬁcation of the oceans. Major future ocean carbon challenges in the ﬁelds of ocean observations, modelling and process research as well as the relevance of other biogeochemical cycles and greenhouse gases are discussed.},

Distributions of tropical Indo-Pacific shore fishes revealed a concentration of species richness in the northern apex and central region of the Coral Triangle epicenter of marine biodiversity. This pattern was supported by distributions of invertebrates and habitat-forming primary producers. Habitat availability, heterogeneity, and sea surface temperatures were highly correlated with species richness across spatial grains ranging from 23,000 to 5,100,000 km2 with and without correction for autocorrelation. The consistent retention of habitat variables in our predictive models supports the area of refuge hypothesis which posits reduced extinction rates in the Coral Triangle. This does not preclude support for a center of origin hypothesis that suggests increased speciation in the region may contribute to species richness. In addition, consistent retention of sea surface temperatures in models suggests that available kinetic energy may also be an important factor in shaping patterns of marine species richness. Kinetic energy may hasten rates of both extinction and speciation. The position of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool to the east of the Coral Triangle in central Oceania and a pattern of increasing species richness from this region into the central and northern parts of the Coral Triangle suggests peripheral speciation with enhanced survival in the cooler parts of the Coral Triangle that also have highly concentrated available habitat. These results indicate that conservation of habitat availability and heterogeneity is important to reduce extinction of marine species and that changes in sea surface temperatures may influence the evolutionary potential of the region.},

	abstract = {Climate change is driving changes in the physical and chemical properties of the ocean that have consequences for marine ecosystems. Here, we review evidence for the responses of marine life to recent climate change across ocean regions, from tropical seas to polar oceans. We consider observed changes in calciﬁcation rates, demography, abundance, distribution, and phenology of marine species. We draw on a database of observed climate change impacts on marine species, supplemented with evidence in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We discuss factors that limit or facilitate species’ responses, such as ﬁshing pressure, the availability of prey, habitat, light and other resources, and dispersal by ocean currents. We ﬁnd that general trends in species’ responses are consistent with expectations from climate change, including shifts in distribution to higher latitudes and to deeper locations, advances in spring phenology, declines in calciﬁcation, and increases in the abundance of warm-water species. The volume and type of evidence associated with species responses to climate change is variable across ocean regions and taxonomic groups, with predominance of evidence derived from the heavily-studied north Atlantic Ocean. Most investigations of the impact of climate change being associated with the impacts of changing temperature, with few observations of effects of changing oxygen, wave climate, precipitation (coastal waters), or ocean acidiﬁcation. Observations of species responses that have been linked to anthropogenic climate change are widespread, but are still lacking for some taxonomic groups (e.g., phytoplankton, benthic invertebrates, marine mammals).},

Most studies addressing connectivity focused on spatial design (e.g. size and spacing) of marine protected areas (MPAs) or clustering of planning units. Climate change recommendations were primarily based on features related to MPA placement (e.g. preferences for areas relatively resilient and resistant to climate change impacts). Quantitative methods to identify spatial or temporal dynamics of features related to connectivity and/or climate change (e.g. functionally well-connected or thermal refugia areas) were rare, and these accounted for the majority of ecologically justiﬁed statements. Given these shortcomings in the literature, we outline a framework for setting marine conservation planning objectives that describes six key approaches to more effectively integrate connectivity and climate change into conservation plans, aligning opportunities and minimizing trade-offs between both issues.},

	abstract = {Assessing pathways of introduction of marine alien species is essential to identify management options and evaluate management decisions to regulate and prevent new introductions. By critically reviewing related information in scientiﬁc/grey literature and online resources, 1369 alien marine species in European seas were identiﬁed, of which 1257 were linked to the most probable pathway(s)/vector(s) of introduction. Based on their reported year of introduction, trends in the numbers of introduced species per pathway/vector were assessed on a decadal basis and invasion patterns were described for each pathway. The trend of new introductions of alien species in Europe has been increasing, with more than half of the species probably being introduced by shipping. Marine and inland corridors (primarily because of the Suez Canal) were the second most common pathway of introduction followed by aquaculture and aquarium trade. Aquaculture was the only pathway for which there was a marked decrease in new introductions during the last decade, presumably due to compulsory measures implemented at a national or European level. Introductions via all the other pathways have been increasing, aquarium trade being the pathway with the most striking observed increase. Many more species are expected to invade the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal, as it has been continuously enlarged and the barriers for the invasion of Red Sea species have been substantially decreased. In addition to the existing regulations on aquaculture, the implementation of appropriate management measures on shipping and aquarium trade, e.g. the implementation of the Ballast Water Management Convention, awareness raising among aquarium hobbyists, and also implementation of a stricter legislative framework on the import of non-native aquarium species, could reverse the increasing trend in new introductions.},

We acquired imagery over high-diversity Amazonian tropical forest landscapes in Peru with the Carnegie Airborne Observatory and developed an unsupervised method to estimate the Shannon index (H0) and variations in species composition using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (BC) and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). An extensive ﬁeld plot network was used for the validation of remotely sensed a- and b-diversity. Airborne maps of H0 were highly correlated with ﬁeld a-diversity estimates (r ¼ 0.86), and BC was estimated with demonstrable accuracy (r ¼ 0.61–0.76). Our ﬁndings are the ﬁrst direct and spatially explicit remotely sensed estimates of a- and b-diversity of humid tropical forests, paving the way for new applications using airborne and space-based imaging spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {Although satellite-based variables have for long been expected to be key components to a uniﬁed and global biodiversity monitoring strategy, a deﬁnitive and agreed list of these variables still remains elusive. The growth of interest in biodiversity variables observable from space has been partly underpinned by the development of the essential biodiversity variable (EBV) framework by the Group on Earth Observations – Biodiversity Observation Network, which itself was guided by the process of identifying essential climate variables. This contribution aims to advance the development of a global biodiversity monitoring strategy by updating the previously published deﬁnition of EBV, providing a deﬁnition of satellite remote sensing (SRS) EBVs and introducing a set of principles that are believed to be necessary if ecologists and space agencies are to agree on a list of EBVs that can be routinely monitored from space. Progress toward the identiﬁcation of SRS-EBVs will require a clear understanding of what makes a biodiversity variable essential, as well as agreement on who the users of the SRS-EBVs are. Technological and algorithmic developments are rapidly expanding the set of opportunities for SRS in monitoring biodiversity, and so the list of SRS-EBVs is likely to evolve over time. This means that a clear and common platform for data providers, ecologists, environmental managers, policy makers and remote sensing experts to interact and share ideas needs to be identiﬁed to support long-term coordinated actions.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are major repositories of biodiversity, but are fast disappearing as land is converted to agriculture. Decisionmakers need to know which of the remaining forests to prioritize for conservation, but the only spatial information on forest biodiversity has, until recently, come from a sparse network of ground-based plots. Here we explore whether airborne hyperspectral imagery can be used to predict the alpha diversity of upper canopy trees in a West African forest. The abundance of tree species were collected from 64 plots (each 1250 m2 in size) within a Sierra Leonean national park, and Shannon-Wiener biodiversity indices were calculated. An airborne spectrometer measured reflectances of 186 bands in the visible and near-infrared spectral range at 1 m2 resolution. The standard deviations of these reflectance values and their first-order derivatives were calculated for each plot from the c. 1250 pixels of hyperspectral information within them. Shannon-Wiener indices were then predicted from these plot-based reflectance statistics using a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest). The regression model fitted the data well (pseudo-R2 = 84.9\%), and we show that standard deviations of green-band reflectances and infra-red region derivatives had the strongest explanatory powers. Our work shows that airborne hyperspectral sensing can be very effective at mapping canopy tree diversity, because its high spatial resolution allows within-plot heterogeneity in reflectance to be characterized, making it an effective tool for monitoring forest biodiversity over large geographic scales.},

In fact, structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry coupled with imagery acquired by UAVs offers a rapid and inexpensive tool to produce high-resolution orthomosaics, giving ecologists a new way for responsive, timely, and cost-effective monitoring of ecological processes. Here, we adopted a lightweight quadcopter as an aerial survey tool and object-based image analysis (OBIA) workﬂow to demonstrate the strength of such methods in producing very high spatial resolution maps of sensitive marine habitats. Therefore, three different coastal environments were mapped using the autonomous ﬂight capability of a lightweight UAV equipped with a fully stabilized consumer-grade RGB digital camera. In particular we investigated a Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadow, a rocky coast with nurseries for juvenile ﬁsh, and two sandy areas showing biogenic reefs of Sabelleria alveolata. We adopted, for the ﬁrst time, UAV-based raster thematic maps of these key coastal habitats, produced after OBIA classiﬁcation, as a new method for ﬁne-scale, low-cost, and time saving characterization of sensitive marine environments which may lead to a more effective and efﬁcient monitoring and management of natural resources.},

This study describes the test of two new methods to perform georeferenced underwater photogrammetry. The ﬁrst one uses the coupling between photogrammetry by scuba diving and positioning with acoustic data from a multibeam echo sounder; the second one utilises direct positioning technology with a surface ﬂoating device (photogrammetric platform). When compared with one another, the platform had a higher mapping efﬁciency, while being limited by depth and underwater visibility. Georeferenced underwater photogrammetry is expected to have a wide range of applications in the ﬁeld of marine habitats’ conservation such as seagrass meadows and the survey of submerged man-made structures such as artiﬁcial reefs and port infrastructure.},

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and afﬁne or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efﬁciently detected through a staged ﬁltering approach that identiﬁes stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest-neighbor indexing method that identiﬁes candidate object matches. Final veriﬁcation of each match is achieved by ﬁnding a low-residual least-squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially-occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds.},

In recent work, the calculation time is reduced by local BAs applied in an incremental scheme. The drift may be reduced by fusion of GPS and Structure-from-Motion. An existing fusion method is BA minimizing a weighted sum of image and GPS errors. This paper introduces two constrained BAs for fusion, which enforce an upper bound for the reprojection error. These BAs are alternatives to the existing fusion BA, which does not guarantee a small reprojection error and requires a weight as input. Then the three fusion BAs are integrated in an incremental Structure-from-Motion method based on local BA. Lastly, we will compare the fusion results on long monocular image sequences and low cost GPS.},

With the growing use of consumer cameras, its application is becoming easier, thus benefiting a wide variety of disciplines. However, utilizing cameras for underwater photogrammetry poses some nontrivial modeling problems due to refraction effect and the extension of the imaging system into a unit of both the camera and the protecting housing device. This paper studies the effect that the underwater environment has on the photogrammetric process, and proposes a model for describing the geometric distortions and for estimating the additional parameters involved. The proposed model accounts not only for the multimedia effect, but also for inaccuracies related to the setting of the camera and housing device. The paper shows that only a small number of additional parameters is needed to model both elements and to preserve the collinearity relation. The results show that no unique setup is needed for estimating the additional parameters and that the estimation is insensitive to noise or first approximations. Experiments show that high levels of accuracy can be achieved.},

Projecting the likely impacts on biodiversity of different policy decisions allows decision makers to understand if and how these targets can be met. We projected trends in two widely used indicators of population abundance Geometric Mean Abundance, equivalent to the Living Planet Index and extinction risk (the Red List Index) under different climate and land-use change scenarios. Testing these on terrestrial carnivore and ungulate species, we found that both indicators decline steadily, and by 2050, under a Businessas-usual (BAU) scenario, geometric mean population abundance declines by 18–35\% while extinction risk increases for 8–23\% of the species, depending on assumptions about species responses to climate change. BAU will therefore fail Convention on Biological Diversity target 12 of improving the conservation status of known threatened species. An alternative sustainable development scenario reduces both extinction risk and population losses compared with BAU and could lead to population increases. Our approach to model species responses to global changes brings the focus of scenarios directly to the species level, thus taking into account an additional dimension of biodiversity and paving the way for including stronger ecological foundations into future biodiversity scenario assessments.},

	abstract = {The concept of ecosystem services has gained traction as a means of linking societal beneﬁts to the underlying ecology and functioning of ecosystems, and is now frequently included in decision-making and legislation. Moving the ecosystem service concept from theory into practice is now crucial. However, advancements in this area of research differ by ecosystem type, and marine systems lag signiﬁcantly behind terrestrial counterparts in terms of understanding, implementation, and number of studies. In this paper we explore several reasons why ecosystem service research has been limited in marine systems and we outline the challenges that hinder progress. Marine systems suffer from a scarcity of spatial data relative to terrestrial counterparts. In terrestrial systems the spatial patterns of land-use/land-cover (LULC) are relatively straightforward to access via satellite and have been used as proxy indicators of service provisions. In contrast, remote sensing tools used to study the surface of the Earth are much less effective at capturing images of the seabed, and by extension marine habitats. Marine waters and their constituents are also frequently driven great distances by winds, tides, and currents. This creates a challenge for management as the identiﬁcation and protection of areas where ecosystem services are exploited is not necessarily sufﬁcient to ensure sustained service delivery. Further complications arise from the three-dimensional uses of marine systems, incorporating activities that use the sea surface, the water column and the benthic habitats below. Progress is being made as technological advancements are resulting in the acquisition of spatial data at faster rates and higher resolutions than previously possible. There is a growing capacity to map, model and value an increasing number of services with initiatives such as InVEST or principle-based modeling. We suggest that awareness is needed around the limited progress in marine systems as this could affect the way we value the biosphere and the relative proportion between biomes.},

	abstract = {Structural complexity is a key factor in ecology, often positively linked to biodiversity and carrying capacity of habitats. However, deﬁning quantitatively the ecological role of structural complexity remains a challenge, mainly due to its unclear deﬁnition and lack of accurate measurement tools and indices. The most common structural complexity indices used in ecological studies are the “Rugosity index” and “Fractal Dimension.” However, these indices cannot appraise or overlook certain complexity indications that may play important ecological roles, such as the different characteristics of structural elements or different spatial scales of structural complexity. This study attempts to tackle these challenges by: 1. examining a new method for structural complexity measurement (“Point-Intercept Contour” or PIC), which may allow calculation of different complexity indices; 2. measuring structural complexity on different spatial scales, each of which may affect or reﬂect on different ecological factors; and 3. comparing three different indices of structural complexity (i.e., “Rugosity index,” “Coefﬁcient of Variation,” and “Neighbor’s Distance”) at different spatial scales, in natural reefs in the Philippines. The PIC method has proven to be easy to perform, provides informative data about structural complexity elements, and enables the calculation of all three indices on different spatial scales. The different spatial scales revealed different patterns among sites that emphasize the importance of considering spatial scaling when expressing different ecological aspects that may indicate reef health. The three indices showed similar general trends, with some differences between scales that reveal some advantages and some drawbacks to each index. The study demonstrates the importance of structural complexity at different spatial scales, and suggests a series of considerations for the use of relevant methods and indices with emphasis on an inexpensive, facile tool for quantitative structural complexity measurements.},

	abstract = {We present thorough this review the developments in the ﬁeld, point out their current limitations, and outline its timelines and unique potential. In order to do so we introduce the methods used in each of the advances in the application of deep learning (DL) to coral research that took place between the years: 2016–2018. DL has unique capability of streamlining the description, analysis, and monitoring of coral reefs, saving time, and obtaining higher reliability and accuracy compared with error-prone human performance. Coral reefs are the most diverse and complex of marine ecosystems, undergoing a severe decline worldwide resulting from the adverse synergistic inﬂuences of global climate change, ocean acidiﬁcation, and seawater warming, exacerbated by anthropogenic eutrophication and pollution. DL is an extension of some of the concepts originating from machine learning that join several multilayered neural networks. Machine learning refers to algorithms that automatically detect patterns in data. In the case of corals these data are underwater photographic images. Based on “learned” patterns, such programs can recognize new images. The novelty of DL is in the use of state-of-art computerized image analyses technologies, and its fully automated methodology of dealing with large data sets of images. Automated Image recognition refers to technologies that identify and detect objects or attributes in a digital video or image automatically. Image recognition classiﬁes data into selected categories out of many. We show that Neural Network methods are already reliable in distinguishing corals from other benthos and non-coral organisms. Automated recognition of live coral cover is a powerful indicator of reef response to slow and transient changes in the environment. Improving automated recognition of coral species, DL methods already recognize decline of coral diversity due to natural and anthropogenic stressors. Diversity indicators can document the eﬀectiveness of reef bioremediation initiatives. We explored the current applications of deep learning for corals and benthic image classiﬁcation by discussing the most recent studies conducted by researchers. We review the developments in the ﬁeld, point out their current limitations, and outline their timelines and unique potential. We also discussed a few future research directions in the ﬁelds of deep learning. Future needs are the age detection of single species, in order to track trends in their population recruitment, decline, and recovery. Fine resolution, at the polyp level, is still to be developed, in order to allow separation of species with similar macroscopic features. That reﬁnement of DL will allow such comparisons and their analyses. We conclude that the usefulness of future, more reﬁned automatic identiﬁcation will allow reef comparison, and tracking long term changes in species diversity. The hitherto unused addition of intraspeciﬁc coral color parameters, will add the inclusion of physiological coral responses to environmental conditions and change thereof. The core aim of this review was to underscore the strength and reliability of the DL approach for documenting coral reef features based on an evaluation of the currently available published uses of this method. We expect that this review will encourage researchers from computer vision and marine societies to collaborate on similar long-term joint ventures.},

In particular, we propose the use of Digital Surface Models and Digital Terrain Models for assessing coral colonies extension and height and discriminating between seabed and coral cover. Such information can be coupled with digital rugosity estimates to improve habitat characterization. DTM, DSM and orthophotos were derived and used to compute a series of metrics like coral morphologies, reef topography, coral cover and structural complexity. We show the potentialities offered by underwater photogrammetry and derived products to provide useful basic information for marine habitat mapping, opening the possibility to extend these methods for large-scale assessment and monitoring of coral reefs.},

Communities of living corals create large and dynamic benthic structures that directly affect ecological parameters such as habitat provisioning and light availability, thus influencing overall ecosystem function. Despite the important role 3D structural complexity plays in ecosystem biodiversity and productivity, the field of coral ecology has lacked accessibility to practical technology capable of quantifying 3D characteristics of underwater habitats. Advancements in the field of computer vision has led to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, which provides a simple and cost-effective method for creating high-resolution and spatially accurate 3D reconstructions of natural environments. Integrating SfM approaches into coral reef research and monitoring has provided useful insight into the relationship between 3D habitat complexity and ecological processes. In this study, we examined the relationships among 2D estimates of live coral cover and several metrics of 3D habitat structural complexity among eleven long-term monitoring sites at French Frigate Shoals. Our findings show that coral assemblage structure acts as a significant driver of 3D structural complexity of coral reef habitats at this atoll. This study highlights the importance of diverse and abundant coral assemblages in supporting structurally complex coral reef habitats and provides a framework for future investigations into the ecological role of various coral morphotypes.},

Here, we described an approach to benthic surveys that uses photogrammetric techniques to facilitate the extraction of quantitative metrics for characterization of benthic habitats from the resulting three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of coral reefs. Out of 92 sites surveyed in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, photographs from 85 sites achieved complete alignment and successfully produced 3D reconstructions and digital elevation models (DEMs). Habitat metrics extracted from the DEMs were generally correlated with one another, with the exception of curvature measures, indicating that complexity and curvature measures should be treated separately when quantifying the habitat structure. Fractal dimension D64, calculated by changing resolutions of the DEMs from 1 cm to 64 cm, had the best correlations with other habitat metrics. Fractal dimension was also less affected by changes in orientations of the models compared to surface complexity or slope. These results showed that fractal dimension can be used as a single measure of complexity for the characterization of coral reef habitats. Further investigations into metrics for 3D characterization of habitats should consider relevant spatial scales and focus on obtaining variables that can complement fractal dimension in the characterization of reef habitats.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-temporal underwater photogrammetric survey of a reef patch located in Moorea, French Polynesia, designed to detect a coral growth of 10–15 mm/year. Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry and underwater imagery allows the three-dimensional quantification of reef structural complexity and ecologically relevant characteristics at the patch scale. A high degree of accuracy and fine resolution are required in order to guarantee the repeatability of surveys over time within the same reference system, meaning a proper geodetic network and acquisition scheme are mandatory. Measuring tools and reference points were properly designed in order to constrain the photogrammetric reconstruction. The network adjustment, performed with distance and height difference observations, provided an average accuracy of ± 1.2 mm and ± 2.9 mm in the horizontal and vertical components, respectively. The final accuracies of photogrammetric reconstructions are on the order of 1 cm and few millimeters for the 2017 and 2018 monitoring campaigns, respectively. This results in realized errors in the comparison of about ± 1 cm. Coordinate variations larger than this magnitude can be reasonably interpreted as coral growth or dissolution. The direct comparison of the two subsequent point clouds is effective in order to evaluate trends in growth and perform morphometric analyses. For highly accurate quantitative assessment of local changes, an expert operator can create and analyze specific 2D profiles that are easily produced from the point clouds.},

	abstract = {For this article, I reviewed empirical studies ﬁnding signiﬁcant ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se—in other words, signiﬁcant responses to fragmentation independent of the effects of habitat amount (hereafter referred to as habitat fragmentation). I asked these two questions: Are most signiﬁcant responses to habitat fragmentation negative or positive? And do particular attributes of species or landscapes lead to a predominance of negative or positive signiﬁcant responses? I found 118 studies reporting 381 signiﬁcant responses to habitat fragmentation independent of habitat amount. Of these responses, 76\% were positive. Most signiﬁcant fragmentation effects were positive, irrespective of how the authors controlled for habitat amount, the measure of fragmentation, the taxonomic group, the type of response variable, or the degree of specialization or conservation status of the species or species group. No support was found for predictions that most signiﬁcant responses to fragmentation should be negative in the tropics, for species with larger movement ranges, or when habitat amount is low; most signiﬁcant fragmentation effects were positive in all of these cases. Thus, although 24\% of signiﬁcant responses to habitat fragmentation were negative, I found no conditions in which most responses were negative. Authors suggest a wide range of possible explanations for signiﬁcant positive responses to habitat fragmentation: increased functional connectivity, habitat diversity, positive edge effects, stability of predator–prey/host–parasitoid systems, reduced competition, spreading of risk, and landscape complementation. A consistent preponderance of positive signiﬁcant responses to fragmentation implies that there is no justiﬁcation for assigning lower conservation value to a small patch than to an equivalent area within a large patch—instead, it implies just the opposite. This ﬁnding also suggests that land sharing will usually provide higher ecological value than land sparing.},

We developed high-resolution habitat fragmentation models and used phylogenetic comparative methods to quantify the effects of habitat fragmentation on the world’s terrestrial mammals, including 4,018 species across 26 taxonomic Orders. Results demonstrate that species with more fragmentation are at greater risk of extinction, even after accounting for the effects of key macroecological predictors, such as body size and geographic range size. Species with higher fragmentation had smaller ranges and a lower proportion of high-suitability habitat within their range, and most high-suitability habitat occurred outside of protected areas, further elevating extinction risk. Our models provide a quantitative evaluation of extinction risk assessments for species, allow for identification of emerging threats in species not classified as threatened, and provide maps of global hotspots of fragmentation for the world’s terrestrial mammals. Quantification of habitat fragmentation will help guide threat assessment and strategic priorities for global mammal conservation.},

	abstract = {Maintaining ecosystem continuity has become a central element in spatial planning policies. Several authors acknowledge the environmental, also known as landscape, fragmentation due to human action as one of the main causes which have negative effects on biodiversity. The phenomenon consists of the transformation of larger patches of habitat in smaller ones, or fragments, which tend to be more isolated than in the original condition. It is extremely evident in urban areas, including settlements and various transport and mobility infrastructures, whose main ecological effects include loss of habitat, increased mortality of plants, and isolation of animal and vegetal species. In this paper, we assess landscape fragmentation dynamics of six landscape units belonging to two European regions, i.e. Sardinia in Italy (from 2003 to 2008), and Andalusia in Spain (from 2005 to 2009). We developed on three indices: the Infrastructural Fragmentation Index (IFI), the Urban Fragmentation Index (UFI), and the Connectivity Index (CI). We found that coastal areas generally suffer from an higher pressure due to the demand of longer or faster transport infrastructures and new settlements and less fragmented areas tend to show the most relevant dynamics in a sort of convergent pattern. Even though landscape fragmentation and connectivity are intuitively complementary phenomena, in this paper we did not found any statistical evidence of this associative property.},

	abstract = {Background: Point clouds with increased point densities create new opportunities for analyzing landscape structure in 3D space. Taking advantage of these dense point clouds we have extended a 2D forest fragmentation index developed for regional scale analyses into a 3D index for analyzing vegetation structure at a much finer scale.
Methods: Based on the presence or absence of points in a 3D raster (voxel model) the 3D fragmentation index is used to evaluate the configuration of a cell’s 3D neighborhood resulting in fragmentation classes such as interior, edge, or patch. In order to incorporate 3D fragmentation into subsequent conventional 2D analyses, we developed a transformation of this 3D fragmentation index into a series of 2D rasters based on index classes.
Results: We applied this method to a point cloud obtained by airborne lidar capturing a suburban area with mixed forest cover. All processing and visualization was done in GRASS GIS, an open source, geospatial processing and remote sensing tool. The newly developed code is also publicly available and open source. The entire processing chain is available and executable through Docker for maximum reproducibility.
Conclusions: We demonstrated that this proposed index can be used to describe different types of vegetation structure making it a promising tool for remote sensing and landscape ecology. Finally, we suggest that processing point clouds using 3D raster methods including 3D raster algebra is as straightforward as using well-established 2D raster and image processing methods.},

	abstract = {Modern neural networks are typically trained in an over-parameterized regime where the parameters of the model far exceed the size of the training data. Such neural networks in principle have the capacity to (over)ﬁt any set of labels including pure noise. Despite this, somewhat paradoxically, neural network models trained via ﬁrst-order methods continue to predict well on yet unseen test data. This paper takes a step towards demystifying this phenomena. Under a rich dataset model, we show that gradient descent is provably robust to noise/corruption on a constant fraction of the labels despite overparameterization. In particular, we prove that: (i) In the ﬁrst few iterations where the updates are still in the vicinity of the initialization gradient descent only ﬁts to the correct labels essentially ignoring the noisy labels. (ii) to start to overﬁt to the noisy labels network must stray rather far from from the initialization which can only occur after many more iterations. Together, these results show that gradient descent with early stopping is provably robust to label noise and shed light on the empirical robustness of deep networks as well as commonly adopted heuristics to prevent overﬁtting.},

We investigated the vertical and horizontal distributions of ␣ and ␤ taxonomic (TD), functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) in a three-dimensional structured ecosystem. We focused on the Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages which form complex structures both vertically and horizontally, and are considered as the most diverse and threatened communities of the Mediterranean Sea. Although comparable to tropical reef assemblages in terms of richness, biomass and production, coralligenous assemblages are less known and more rarely studied, in particular because of their location in deep waters. Our study covers the entire range of distribution of coralligenous habitats along the French Mediterranean coasts, representing the most complete database so far developed for this important ecosystem. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst analysis of spatial diversity patterns of marine biodiversity on both horizontal and vertical scales.},

	abstract = {Aim Investigations into how different facets of biodiversity are related has become
a central research agenda in ecology. Here, we use a large-scale and high-resolution
data set on bird distribution to examine the robustness of the relationships between
species diversity and functional or phylogenetic diversity.
Location France
Methods We measured the functional and phylogenetic diversity of 1914 bird
assemblages monitored over 10 years with a standardized protocol.We investigated
the consequences of incorporating abundance versus presence–absence data,
changing the number and identity of traits considered, or varying the spatial scale
used to estimate functional and phylogenetic diversity. We further examined the
outcomes of different null model procedures that aim to reveal ecological processes
influencing the distribution of each facet of diversity.
Results We found that the shape and strength of the relationship between species
diversity and functional diversity are structured by several methodological choices.
We show that increasing the quantity of information yielded by the indices (in
particular, including abundances or increasing the number of traits considered)
decreases the amount of functional redundancy estimated. Reducing the number of
functional traits used to estimate functional diversity can change and even reverse
the relationship of interest.Moreover, using alternative null models, we highlighted
the specific role of environmental filtering and the link between species abundances
and their functional originality (defined for a given species as the average of the
functional distances with other species). The same tests applied to phylogenetic
diversity revealed that its relationship with species diversity varies differently suggesting
that this latter index cannot be used as a proxy for functional diversity.
Main conclusions Our results show that the identification of patterns and processes
linking species diversity to functional or phylogenetic diversity vary with
methodological choices. We further show that the study of these sources of variation
via robustness tests allows ecologically meaningful information to be separated
from pure artefacts.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica, which provides highly valuable ecosystem services, is subject to increasing anthropogenic pressures, causing habitat loss or fragmentation. Whilst airborne images and acoustic data can be used for monitoring seagrass coverage at a macro-scale and over long time periods, monitoring its health in the short term requires precision mapping in order to assess current regression/progression of individual meadows. However, current fine-scale underwater techniques in the field are imprecise and time-demanding. We propose an automatic classification approach based on underwater photogrammetry for an operational, cost- and time-effective fine-scale monitoring method. The method uses a property of the sparse cloud generated during bundle adjustment — the reconstruction uncertainty — to map seagrass patches. The mean precision, recall and F1 score of the method over 21 study sites with different morphologies were 0.79, 0.91 and 0.84, respectively. However, the fragmentation level of the meadows had a significant negative effect on classification performances. The temporal monitoring of 3 sites using this method proved its operability and showed a positive evolution index of the corresponding meadows over a period of 3 yr. This method is generalizable for most encountered configurations and can be integrated in a large monitoring system, as it enables the production of numerous seagrass maps over a short period of time. Moreover, our methodology could be generalized and applied in the study of other submerged aquatic vegetation by adjusting the method’s parameters.},

	abstract = {Monitoring the ecological status of natural habitats is crucial to the conservation process, as it enables the implementation of efficient conservation policies. Nowadays, it is increasingly possible to automate species identification, given the availability of very large image databases and state-of-the-art computational power which makes the training of automated machine learning-based classification models an increasingly viable tool for monitoring marine habitats. Coralligenous reefs are an underwater habitat of particular importance, found in the Mediterranean. This habitat is of a similar biocomplexity to coral reefs. They have been monitored in French waters since 2010 using manually annotated photo quadrats (RECOR monitoring network). Based on the large database of annotations accumulated therein, we have trained convolutional neural networks to automatically recognise coralligenous species using the data gathered from photo quadrats. Previous studies conducted on similar habitats performed well, but were only able to consider a limited number of classes, resulting in a very coarse description of these often-complex habitats. We therefore designed a custom network based on off-theshelf architectures which is able to discriminate between 61 classes with 72.59\% accuracy. Our results showed that confusion errors were for the most part taxonomically coherent, showing accuracy performances of 84.47\% when the task was simplified to 15 major categories, thereby outperforming the human accuracy previously recorded in a similar study. In light of this, we built a semi-automated tool to reject unsure results and reduce error risk, for when a higher level of accuracy is required. Finally, we used our model to assess the biodiversity and ecological status of coralligenous reefs with the Coralligenous Assemblage Index (CAI) and the Shannon Index. Our results showed that whilst the prediction of the CAI was only moderately accurate (pearson correlation between observed and predicted CAI = 0.61), the prediction of Shannon Index was more accurate (pearson correlation = 0.74). In conclusion, it will be argued that the approach outlined by this study offers a cost and time-effective tool for the analysis of coralligenous assemblages which is suitable for integration into a large-scale monitoring network of this habitat.},

	abstract = {Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the ﬂexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The teststatistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher’s F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},
